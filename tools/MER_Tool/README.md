# MER (Minimal Named-Entity Recognizer)

MER is a Named-Entity Recognition tool which given any lexicon and any input text returns the list of 
terms recognized in the text, including their exact location (annotations).

Given an ontology (owl file) MER is also able to link the entities to their classes.

More information about MER can be found in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316545534_MER_a_Minimal_Named-Entity_Recognition_Tagger_and_Annotation_Server

A demo is also available at: http://labs.fc.ul.pt/mer/

## Dependencies

### awk

MER was developed and tested using the GNU awk (gawk) and grep. If you have another awk interpreter in your machine, there's no assurance that the program will work.

For example, to install GNU awk on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install gawk
```

## Basic Usage Example

### Pre-Processing of a Lexicon

Let's walk trough an example of adding a sample lexicon to MER. 

First, we have to create the lexicon file in the _data_ folder:

```txt
α-maltose
nicotinic acid
nicotinic acid D-ribonucleotide
nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate
```

Assuming that the file is called "lexicon.txt", you process it as follows:

```shell
(cd data; ../produce_data_files.sh lexicon.txt)
```

Some examples of labels are shown as output so you can check that it worked.
This will create all the necessary files to use MER with the given lexicon. 

### Recognizing Entities

The script receives as input a text and a lexicon:

```shell
./get_entities.sh [text] [lexicon]
```

So, let's try to find mentions in a snippet of text:

```shell
./get_entities.sh 'α-maltose and nicotinic acid D-ribonucleotide was found, but not nicotinic acid' lexicon
```

The output will be a TSV looking like this:

```tsv
0       9       α-maltose
14      28      nicotinic acid
65      79      nicotinic acid
14      45      nicotinic acid D-ribonucleotide
```

The first column corresponds to the start-index, the second to the end-index and the third to the annotated term.

## Ontology and PubMed

Now, lets recognize and map terms from an ontology in PubMed abstracts.

For example, you can start by downloading the human disease ontology:

```shell 
(cd data; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/master/src/ontology/doid-simple.owl)
```

and process it:

```shell
(cd data; ../produce_data_files.sh doid-simple.owl)
```

Now, download some abstracts from PubMed, for example ([29490421](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490421) and [29490060](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490060))

```shell
text=$(curl "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=29490421,29490060&retmode=text&rettype=xml" | xmllint --xpath '//AbstractText/text()' /dev/stdin)
```

Check the diseases recognized: 

```shell
./get_entities.sh "$text" doid-simple 
```

The output should be something like this:

```txt
218	234	hypersensitivity
540	545	croup
558	564	asthma
1118	1124	asthma
1145	1155	dermatitis
1166	1182	hypersensitivity
1013	1031	multiple sclerosis
1137	1155	contact dermatitis
```

To get the IDs of the terms recognized, you can execute:  

```shell
./get_entities.sh "$text" doid-simple | ./link_entities.sh data/doid-simple.owl
```

The output should be something like this:
```txt
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2841	asthma
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3083	COPD
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3083	COPD
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2841	asthma
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_6132	bronchitis
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2841	asthma
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_4	disease
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_8504	impetigo
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_6543	acne
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2326	gastroenteritis
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_6132	bronchitis
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_10754	otitis media
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_10754	otitis media
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3083	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_13148	urinary tract infection
```
Or if you want to remove duplicates:

```shell
./get_entities.sh "$text" doid-simple | ./link_entities.sh data/doid-simple.owl | sort | uniq
```
you will get the following output: 

```txt
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_10754	otitis media
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_13148	urinary tract infection
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2326	gastroenteritis
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_2841	asthma
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3083	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3083	COPD
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_4	disease
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_6132	bronchitis
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_6543	acne
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_8504	impetigo
```

For example, you can now use these IDs to calculate their semantic similarity using [DiShIn](https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/DiShIn)

## Test

To check if the result is what was expected try:

```shell
./test.sh
```

if something is wrong, please check if you are using UTF-8 encoding and that you have GNU awk and grep installed.
