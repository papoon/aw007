The aim of this study was to measure submaximal [Formula: see text]O and C during a range of set walking speeds (SWS; 0.56 - 1.94 m⋅s, increment 0.28 m⋅s), set running speeds (SRS; 1.67 - 3.33 m⋅s, increment 0.28 m⋅s) and a self-selected walking speed (SSW). [Formula: see text]O and C was scaled to total body mass (TBM) and fat free mass (FFM) while gait speed was scaled to leg length using Froude\'s number (Fr). Achondroplasic [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O were on average 29 and 35% greater during SWS ( < 0.05) and 12 and 18% higher during SRS ( < 0.05) than controls, respectively. Achondroplasic C and C were 29 and 33% greater during SWS ( < 0.05) and 12 and 18% greater during SRS ( < 0.05) than controls, respectively. There was no difference in SSW [Formula: see text]O or [Formula: see text]O between groups ( > 0.05), but C and C at SSW were 23 and 29% higher ( < 0.05) in the Achondroplasic group compared to controls, respectively. [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O correlated with Fr for both groups ( = 0.984 - 0.999,  < 0.05). Leg length accounted for the majority of the higher [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O in the Achondroplasic group, but further work is required to explain the higher Achondroplasic C and C at all speeds compared to controls.  There is a leftward shift of oxygen consumption scaled to total body mass and fat free mass in Achondroplasic adults when walking and running. This is nullified when talking into account leg length. However, despite these scalars, Achondroplasic individuals have a higher walking and metabolic cost compared to age matched non-Achondroplasic individuals, suggesting biomechanical differences between the groups.','2018-05-13 00:00:00','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-05-07 00:00:00',4,0,'Sims, David T, DT|Onambélé-Pearson, Gladys L, GL|Burden, Adrian, A|Payton, Carl, C|Morse, Christopher I, CI','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(2,1,29681095,'1552-4833','Further delineation of achondroplasia-hypochondroplasia complex with long-term survival.','Achondroplasia-hypochondroplasia (ACH-HCH) complex is caused by the presence of two different pathogenic variants in each allele of FGFR3 gene.

While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0-3], [4-8] and [9-18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (Fgfr3ach/+) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating Fgfr3ach/+ mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.','2018-05-13 00:00:00','2018-04-13 00:00:00','2018-04-29 00:00:00',0,0,'Saint-Laurent, Celine, C|Garcia, Stephanie, S|Sarrazy, Vincent, V|Dumas, Karine, K|Authier, Florence, F|Sore, Sophie, S|Tran, Albert, A|Gual, Philippe, P|Gennero, Isabelle, I|Salles, Jean-Pierre, JP|Gouze, Elvire, E','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(4,1,29622960,'2090-911X','A case of multivessel PTCA in achondroplasia patient.','No abstract found.','2017-03-01 00:00:00','2016-03-15 00:00:00','2018-04-08 00:00:00',4,0,'Kumar, Viveka, V|Kumar, Vivek, V','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(5,1,29593476,'1661-8769','Novel and Recurrent Mutations in the  Gene and Double Heterozygosity Cases in a Cohort of Brazilian Patients with Skeletal Dysplasia.','Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene () cause achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), and thanatophoric dysplasia types I and II (TDI/TDII).

One of them had a classical TDI phenotype but a typical ACH mutation (c.1138G>A) in combination with a novel c.1130T>C mutation predicted as being pathogenic. The presence of the second c.1130T>C mutation likely explained the more severe phenotype. Another atypical patient presented with a compound phenotype that resulted from a combination of ACH and X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (OMIM 313400).

This mutation induces dysfunction of the growth cartilage, leading to abnormalities in the development of trabecular bone. Because the mutation is autosomal dominant, these perinates have a 50% risk of having been affected. This study determines whether trabecular bone microarchitecture (TBMA) analysis is useful for detecting genetic dwarfism. Proximal metaphyses of humeri were μCT-scanned with a resolution of 7-12 μm.

Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques; oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-Hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Mutation information and molecular markers investigated to date are not predictive of conversion. Prior reports have focused on toxic metabolic byproducts and reactive oxygen species as instigators of cerebral inflammation and subsequent immune cell invasion leading to BBB breakdown. This study focuses on the BBB itself and evaluates differences in brain endothelium integrity using cells from ccALD patients and wild-type (WT) controls.The blood-brain barrier of ccALD patients and WT controls was modeled using directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs). Immunocytochemistry and PCR confirmed characteristic expression of brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) markers. Barrier properties of iBMECs were measured via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), sodium fluorescein permeability, and frayed junction analysis. Electron microscopy and RNA-seq were used to further characterize disease-specific differences. Oil-Red-O staining was used to quantify differences in lipid accumulation. To evaluate whether treatment with block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) (PEO-PPO) could mitigate defective properties, ccALD-iBMECs were treated with PEO-PPO block copolymers and their barrier properties and lipid accumulation levels were quantified.iBMECs from patients with ccALD had significantly decreased TEER (2592 ± 110 Ω cm) compared to WT controls (5001 ± 172 Ω cm). They also accumulated lipid droplets to a greater extent than WT-iBMECs. Upon treatment with a PEO-PPO diblock copolymer during the differentiation process, an increase in TEER and a reduction in lipid accumulation were observed for the polymer treated ccALD-iBMECs compared to untreated controls.The finding that BBB integrity is decreased in ccALD and can be rescued with block copolymers opens the door for the discovery of BBB-specific molecular markers that can indicate the onset of ccALD and has therapeutic implications for preventing the conversion to ccALD.','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Lee, Catherine A A, CAA|Seo, Hannah S, HS|Armien, Anibal G, AG|Bates, Frank S, FS|Tolar, Jakub, J|Azarin, Samira M, SM','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(21,3,29751240,'1573-2517','Temperament clusters associate with anxiety disorder comorbidity in depression.','Individual temperament is associated with psychiatric morbidity and could explain differences in psychiatric comorbidities.

It is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology consider antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Several classes of antidepressants have been studied and compared, but it is still unclear which antidepressants have a more or less favourable profile in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of this condition.To assess the effects of antidepressants for panic disorder in adults, specifically:1. to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison to placebo;2. to review the acceptability of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo; and3. to investigate the adverse effects of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, including the general prevalence of adverse effects, compared to placebo.We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders\' (CCMD) Specialised Register, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to May 2017.

We entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and settings. Primary outcomes included failure to respond, measured by a range of response scales, and treatment acceptability, measured by total number of dropouts for any reason. Secondary outcomes included failure to remit, panic symptom scales, frequency of panic attacks, agoraphobia, general anxiety, depression, social functioning, quality of life and patient satisfaction, measured by various scales as defined in individual studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one unique RCTs including 9377 participants overall, of whom we included 8252 in the 49 placebo-controlled arms of interest (antidepressant as monotherapy and placebo alone) in this review. The majority of studies were of moderate to low quality due to inconsistency, imprecision and unclear risk of selection and performance bias.We found low-quality evidence that revealed a benefit for antidepressants as a group in comparison with placebo in terms of efficacy measured as failure to respond (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.79; participants = 6500; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 6 to 9): that means seven people would need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. We observed the same finding when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo.Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit for antidepressants compared to placebo when looking at number of dropouts due to any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; participants = 7850; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a NNTB of 27 (95% CI 17 to 105); treating 27 people will result in one person fewer dropping out. Considering antidepressant classes, TCAs showed a benefit over placebo, while for SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) we observed no difference.When looking at dropouts due to adverse effects, which can be considered as a measure of tolerability, we found moderate-quality evidence showing that antidepressants as a whole are less well tolerated than placebo. In particular, TCAs and SSRIs produced more dropouts due to adverse effects in comparison with placebo, while the confidence interval for SNRI, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and other antidepressants were wide and included the possibility of no difference.The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review.Based on these results, antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder. Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7, implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with placebo in terms of number of dropouts, but a less favourable profile in terms of dropout due to adverse effects. However, the tolerability profile varied between different classes of antidepressants.The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice cannot be made on the basis of this review.Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies, and only assessing short-term outcomes.Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Bighelli, Irene, I|Castellazzi, Mariasole, M|Cipriani, Andrea, A|Girlanda, Francesca, F|Guaiana, Giuseppe, G|Koesters, Markus, M|Turrini, Giulia, G|Furukawa, Toshi A, TA|Barbui, Corrado, C','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(27,3,29592527,'1360-0451','The association between HIV clinical disease severity and psychiatric disorders as seen in Western Romania.','HIV disease continues to be a serious health issue all over the world. By the end of 2016, 36.7 million people were living with HIV, 1.8 million people became newly infected and 1 million died of HIV-related causes/diseases. In order to develop effective treatment strategies, is important to assess the risk factors that affect negatively the HIV-positive patients. HIV-infected patients are at high risk of developing psychiatric disorders in every stage of the illness. Psychiatric disorders can negatively influence the treatment adherence, induce risk behavior and influence the quality of life. The purpose of this study is to determine if the severity of HIV disease is associated with increased frequency of psychiatric disorders. We evaluated 101 HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Western Romania via Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). We conducted a risk analysis in order to see if the patients have a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders depending on HIV serostatus factor (HIV asymptomatic, symptomatic, AIDS converted). Our study shows that, the patients having AIDS and symptomatic HIV have a higher prevalence for the most common psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (OR = 5.81;p < 0.001), panic disorder (OR = 3.11; p = 0.016), agoraphobia (OR = 4.31; p = 0.024), social phobia (OR = 2.81; p = 0.038), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.79; p = 0.006), somatization (OR = 8.72; p < 0.0010) and hypochondria (OR = 4.66; p = 0.0013). Symptomatic HIV and AIDS converted serostatus is also a risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and psychosis. The main conclusion of this study is that the more severe HIV clinical disease was associated with increased frequency of psychiatric disorders. As a consequence, we conclude that psychiatric disorders and HIV/AIDS treatment should be addressed simultaneously, depending on the risk specific factors such as the HIV infection stage and, due to psychiatric repercussions of HIV is expected to become more relevant in the coming years.','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-29 00:00:00',0,0,'Ursoiu, Fulvia, F|Moleriu, Lavinia, L|Lungeanu, Diana, D|Puschită, Maria, M','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(28,3,29580906,'2213-0276','Post-traumatic psychiatric disorders: PTSD is not the only diagnosis.','Traumatic events and their consequences are often hidden or minimised by patients for reasons linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder itself (inexpressibility, shame, depressive thoughts, fear of stigmatisation, etc.). Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains the most widely known disorder, chronic post-traumatic psychiatric disorders are many and varied. After a trauma, the practitioner has to check for the different clinical forms of post-traumatic psychological consequences: PTSD is not the only diagnosis. Based on our own clinical experience compared to the international literature, we think necessary to build a didactic classification describing chronic post-traumatic symptoms and syndromes. Post traumatic depressions and bereavement lead to high risk of suicidal crisis and self-harm behaviours. Re-experiencing are felt with anxiety, hyper arousal increases anxious reactivity, and avoidance strategies increase anticipatory anxiety, indicating post-traumatic anxiety disorders (agoraphobia, specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, social phobia). Characterising an often-severe clinical picture, the co-occurrence of post-traumatic and chronic psychotic symptoms is not unusual (post-traumatic schizophrenia, post-traumatic depression with mood-congruent psychotic features, non-schizophrenic post-traumatic psychotic disorder, and bipolar reaction to trauma). A physical injury occurring at the same time as a traumatic exposure increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder later which, in turn, afflicts the subjective perception of the physical health (development of somatoform and psychosomatic disorders, comorbidity with a post-concussion syndrome). The trauma may cause a rupture in the biography of a person, also in his/her internal physiological functioning as in his/her social activities (impacts of instinctive functions and behaviours, personality changes, and adjustment difficulties on professional and personal life).

The Spanish PDSS showed acceptable internal consistency (α = .74), excellent test-retest (total score and items 1-6: α > .58, p .90) and medium to large convergent validity (r = .68, 95% CI [.54, .79], p < .01; r = .80, 95% CI [.70, .87], p < .01; r = .48, 95% CI [.28, .67], p < .01; BAI, PAS and ASI-3 total scores respectively). Data on divergent validity (BDI-II total score: r = .52, 95% CI [.34, .67], p < .01) suggest some need for refinement of the PDSS. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested a two-factor modified model for the scale (nested χ2 = 14.01, df = 12, p < .001). The Spanish PDSS has similar psychometric properties as the previous versions and is a useful instrument to assess panic symptoms in clinical settings in Spanish-speaking populations.','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00',0,0,'Fuste, Gideoni, G|Gil, María Ángeles, MÁ|López-Solà, Clara, C|Rosado, Silvia, S|Bonillo, Albert, A|Pailhez, Guillem, G|Bulbena, Antoni, A|Pérez, Víctor, V|Fullana, Miguel A, MA','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(30,3,29544715,'2212-0289','[The Jena Anxiety Monitoring List (JAMoL) - a tool for the evidence-based treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care].','Behavior therapy-oriented methods are recommended for treating anxiety disorders in primary care. The treatment of patients with long-term conditions can be improved by case management and structured clinical monitoring. The present paper describes the rationale, design and application of the \'Jena Anxiety Monitoring List\' (JAMoL), a monitoring tool for the treatment of patients with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in primary care.JAMoL\'s design was based on established clinical measures, the rationale of exposure-based anxiety treatment, and research on family practice-based case management. After piloting, the JAMoL was used in the clinical study \'Jena-PARADISE\' (ISRCTN64669297), where non-physician practice staff monitored patients with panic disorder by telephone. Using semi-structured interviews in concomitant studies, study participants were asked about the instrument\'s functionality.The JAMoL assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms (6 items) as well as the patient\'s adherence to therapy (4 items) and fosters the case management-related information exchange (3 items). An integrated traffic light scheme facilitates the evaluation of monitoring results. Within the clinical study, non-physician practice staff carried out a total of 1,525 JAMoL-supported monitoring calls on 177 patients from 30 primary care practices (median calls per patient: 10 [interquartile range, 9-10]). Qualitative analyses revealed that most practice teams and patients rated the JAMoL as a practicable and treatment-relevant tool.The JAMoL enables primary care practice teams to continuously monitor anxiety symptoms and treatment adherence in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Within the behavior therapy-oriented treatment program \'Jena-PARADISE\', the JAMoL constitutes an important case management tool.','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-13 00:00:00','2018-04-30 00:00:00',0,0,'Hiller, Thomas Stephan, TS|Freytag, Antje, A|Breitbart, Jörg, J|Teismann, Tobias, T|Schöne, Elisabeth, E|Blank, Wolfgang, W|Schelle, Mercedes, M|Vollmar, Horst Christian, HC|Margraf, Jürgen, J|Gensichen, Jochen, J|für die Jena-PARADISE Study Group','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(31,4,29753156,'1523-6536','Antiviral T-Cells for Adenovirus in the Pre-Transplant Period: a Bridge Therapy for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.','Viral infections can be life-threatening in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other forms of profound primary immunodeficiency disorders both before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Here we describe the use of VSTs in an infant with RAG1 SCID who had developed disseminated adenovirus which failed to improve on cidofovir. Adenovirus cleared following two doses of VSTs and marrow infusion from a matched unrelated donor, without incidence of graft versus host disease. T cell receptor-b sequencing demonstrated expansion of adenovirus-specific T-cell fraction of the VSTs, suggesting that infusion facilitated viral clearance.

Mokken Scaling analyses were used to examine item structure and consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify predictors of the amount (number of asthma care activities HCPs delivered) and consistency (the degree to which HCPs deliver similar care) of asthma medical care and self-management support.On average, HCPs reported delivering 74,2% of guideline-recommended care. Consistency of medical care and self-management support was lower among HCPs delivering a lower amount of care (r=.58 and r=.57, p<.001). UK HCPs provided more and more consistent asthma self-management support -but not medical care- than French HCPs, which was explained by the presence of practice nurses in the UK. More training, positive social norms, and higher behavioural control explained better quality of care across all HCPs.Using carefully-developed questionnaires and advanced psychometric analyses, this study suggests that involving practice nurses, making social expectations visible, and providing more training to enhance skills and confidence in asthma care delivery could enhance the amount and consistency of asthma primary care.

Abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin antagonistically regulate many developmental processes and environmental stress responses in plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the antagonism remains poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrated that Sucrose nonfermenting1-related kinases SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6, the key kinases of ABA signaling pathway, directly interacted with and phosphorylated type-A response regulator 5 (ARR5), a negative regulator in cytokinin signaling. The phosphorylation of ARR5 at Ser residues by SnRK2s enhanced ARR5 protein stability. Accordingly, overexpression of ARR5 showed ABA hypersensitivity and drought tolerance, which could not be recapitulated by mimic non-phosphorylated ARR5. Moreover, type-B ARR1, 11, and 12 physically interacted with SnRK2s and repressed the kinase activity of SnRK2.6. The arr1,11,12 triple mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA. Genetic analysis demonstrated that SnRK2s act upstream of ARR5 and downstream of ARR1,11,12 in mediating ABA response and drought tolerance. Together, this study unravels the antagonistic action underlying ABA and cytokinin signaling pathways, thus providing insights into how plants coordinate growth and stress response by integrating multiple hormone pathways under drought stress.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Huang, Xiaozhen, X|Hou, Lingyan, L|Meng, Jingjing, J|You, Huiwen, H|Li, Zhen, Z|Gong, Zhizhong, Z|Yang, Shuhua, S|Shi, Yiting, Y','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(39,4,29752758,'1365-2222','Src-type tyrosine kinase p56lck is critical for thymic stromal lymphopoietin-induced allergic rhinitis.','Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a regulator of mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory reactions, but the manner in which TSLP contributes to allergic rhinitis (AR) remains unclear.Here we sought to determine that TSLP plays a crucial role in AR by interacting with Src-type tyrosine kinase p56lck and STAT6 and promoting mast cells degranulation.The effects of TSLP on mast cell degranulation and AR were analyzed in human mast cell line (HMC-1 cells), ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR animal model, and human subjects. Small interfering RNA experiments were performed in HMC-1 cells and OVA-induced AR model. Immune responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and histological studies.TSLP levels and mast cell-derived p56lck activation were elevated in human subjects with AR, and in AR mice, exogenous TSLP accelerated TH2-allergic inflammatory reactions by up-regulating p56lck and STAT6. On the other hand, depletion of TSLP, p56lck, and STAT6 ameliorated clinical symptoms in AR mice. The selective inhibitor of p56lck, damnacanthal inhibits AR reactions.Collectively, these observations suggest a role for TSLP/p56lck/STAT6 in AR and offer insight of potential therapeutic strategies.

Clinical studies directly comparing SCIT and SLIT report a different kinetics and magnitude of immunological changes induced during treatment. Comparative studies into the mechanisms underlying immune suppression in SCIT and SLIT are lacking.We aimed to establish an experimental model for grass pollen (GP) SCIT and SLIT that would allow a head-to-head comparison of the two treatments.Balb/c mice were sensitized with GP-extract, followed by SCIT and SLIT treatments with various GP dosages. Subsequently, we challenged mice with GP and measured airway responsiveness (AHR), GP-specific immunoglobulins, ear-swelling tests (EST), eosinophilic inflammation in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and T-cell cytokine release after re-stimulation of lung cells (IL-5, -10, and -13).We find that SLIT treatment was able to suppress allergen-induced AHR, while allergic inflammation was not effectively suppressed even at the highest GP dose in this model. In contrast, SCIT treatment induced higher levels of GP-specific IgG1, while SLIT was superior in inducing a GP-specific IgG2a response, which was associated with increased Th1 activity in lung tissue after SLIT, but not SCIT treatment. Interestingly, SCIT was able to suppress Th2-type cytokine production in lung cell suspensions, while SLIT failed to do so.In conclusion, GP-SCIT suppresses Th2 inflammation and induced neutralizing antibodies, while GP-SLIT suppresses the clinically relevant lung function parameters in an asthma mouse model, indicating that the two application routes depend on partially divergent mechanisms of tolerance induction. Interestingly, these data mirror observations in clinical studies, underscoring the translational value of these mouse models. This article is protected by copyright.

Adolescents (≥16 years) and adults having a DSD condition were included from 02/2014 to 09/2015. The main outcome QOL was measured by the WHOQOL-BREF (domains of physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment). QOL was compared to country specific reference populations by using unpaired t-tests. Linear regression models explained the additional variance of the diagnosis on QOL.Three hundred one individuals with Turner Syndrome, 219 with Klinefelter Syndrome (including XYY), 226 with 46,XX CAH and 294 with rare DSD conditions (gonadal dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome, severe hypospadias, and androgen synthesis errors or other diagnosis) took part. Compared to healthy European populations, QOL was similar in psychological, slightly worse in physical health, and slightly better in environment. In social relationships, QOL was significantly poorer compared to healthy and non-healthy reference populations. In linear regression models health status was the most important predictor of QOL; additional variance was explained by feelings about household\'s income in all domains, and the relationship status in social relationships. Diagnosis explained nearly no additional variance.Except for social relationships, most people with DSD adapt well to their life circumstances and report a good QOL.

Consistent with this, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments for cycloheximide-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed a relatively large amount of aberrant mRNA produced by the newly created splice acceptor site and a relatively small amount of wildtype mRNA produced by the normal splice acceptor site. Furthermore, most of the aberrant mRNA was shown to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and, if a small amount of aberrant mRNA may have escaped NMD, such mRNA was predicted to generate a truncated AR protein missing some functional domains. These findings imply that the deep intronic mutation creating an alternative splice acceptor site resulted in the production of a relatively small amount of wildtype AR mRNA, leading to PAIS.','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-14 00:00:00',0,0,'Ono, Hiroyuki, H|Saitsu, Hirotomo, H|Horikawa, Reiko, R|Nakashima, Shinichi, S|Ohkubo, Yumiko, Y|Yanagi, Kumiko, K|Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko, K|Fukami, Maki, M|Fujisawa, Yasuko, Y|Ogata, Tsutomu, T','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(45,5,29393262,'1661-5433','Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome at Prepuberty: Marked Loss of Spermatogonial Cells at Early Childhood and Presence of Gonocytes up to Puberty.','Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a hereditary condition in patients with a 46,XY karyotype in which loss-of-function mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene are responsible for defects in virilization. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of the lack of AR activity on germ cell survival and the degree of testicular development reached by these patients by analyzing gonadal tissue from patients with AIS prior to Sertoli cell maturation at puberty. Twenty-three gonads from 13 patients with AIS were assessed and compared to 18 testes from 17 subjects without endocrine disorders. The study of the gonadal structure using conventional microscopy and the ultrastructural characteristics of remnant germ cells using electron microscopy, combined with the immunohistochemical analysis of specific germ cell markers (MAGE-A4 for premeiotic germ cells and of OCT3/4 for gonocytes), enabled us to carry out a thorough investigation of germ cell life in an androgen-insensitive microenvironment throughout prepuberty until young adulthood. Here, we show that germ cell degeneration starts very early, with a marked decrease in number after only 2 years of life, and we demonstrate the permanence of gonocytes in AIS testis samples until puberty, describing 2 different populations. Additionally, our results provide further evidence for the importance of AR signaling in peritubular myoid cells during prepuberty to maintain Sertoli and spermatogonial cell health and survival.','2018-05-13 00:00:00','2018-01-24 00:00:00','2018-02-27 00:00:00',0,0,'Aliberti, Paula, P|Perez Garrido, Natalia, N|Marino, Roxana, R|Ramirez, Pablo, P|Solari, Alberto J, AJ|Sciurano, Roberta, R|Costanzo, Mariana, M|Guercio, Gabriela, G|Warman, Diana Mónica, DM|Bailez, Marcela, M|Baquedano, María Sonia, MS|Rivarola, Marco A, MA|Belgorosky, Alicia, A|Berensztein, Esperanza, E','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(46,5,29388223,'1365-2230','Aberrant breast tissue in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.','No abstract found.','2018-06-01 00:00:00','2018-02-01 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Nazzaro, G, G|Genovese, G, G|Brena, M, M|Passoni, E, E|Tadini, G, G','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(47,5,29386228,'2049-3614','Disorders of sex development: a study of 194 cases.','To study the clinical proﬁle and the management of patients with disorders of sex development (DSD).Retrospective study from a tertiary care hospital of North India.One hundred ninety-four patients of DSD registered in the Endocrine clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh between 1995 and 2014 were included.One hundred and two patients (52.5%) had 46,XY DSD and seventy-four patients (38.1%) had 46,XX DSD.

We used The Health Improvement Network database (comprising the years 2000-2012) to identify incident patients with epilepsy. The index date was that on which they met the case definition for epilepsy, and analyses only included patients who remained on monotherapy or received no AED therapy following diagnosis to avoid confounding by polytherapy. Psychiatric symptoms were defined using mental health clinical or treatment (medical or therapeutic) code. We analyzed the AED of interest as a time-varying covariate in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models controlling for confounding factors. We identified 9595 patients with incident epilepsy, 7400 of whom (77%) received a first-recorded AED prescription. Prescriptions for newer generation AEDs (lamotrigine and levetiracetam) steadily increased (constituting over 30% of all AED prescriptions by 2012) while valproate use significantly declined in females (~40% in 2002 to just over 20% by 2012). A total of 2190 patients were first exposed to carbamazepine (29.3%) and 222 to lamotrigine (3%), both of which were associated with a lower hazard of any coded psychiatric symptom or disorder in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.73-0.97; p = 0.02 and HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.99; p = 0.03, respectively, for carbamazepine and lamotrigine).

We evaluated 746 veterans using the CAPS to assess PTSD and the PHQ-9 to measure depression and suicidal ideation.

In multivariate logistic regression models, this association remained significant after controlling for demographics and symptom severity. Anger, hostility, anxiety, alcohol use, optimism and social support did not explain the elevated risk of suicidal ideation in the comorbid group in fully adjusted models. As suicidal ideation is a known risk factor for suicide attempts and completions, veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression represent a vulnerable group who may need more intensive monitoring and treatment to reduce risk of suicide.','2018-04-22 00:00:00','2018-04-22 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Arenson, Melanie B, MB|Whooley, Mary A, MA|Neylan, Thomas C, TC|Maguen, Shira, S|Metzler, Thomas J, TJ|Cohen, Beth E, BE','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(53,6,29753050,'1878-4216','Sex-specific differences in corticosterone secretion, behavioral phenotypes and expression of TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL receptor isoforms: Impact of systemic TrkB inhibition and combinatory stress exposure in adolescence.','Stress exposure has been implicated in the development of mood disorders, although little is known about the lasting effects of repeated stress during the adolescent period on sex-specific differences in endocrine and plasticity-signaling responses in adulthood. Using a 10-day combinatory stress paradigm (postnatal day (PND) 26 to 35), we examined sex-specific impact of adolescent stress and inhibition of tyrosine-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor (ANA-12; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) on 1) adolescent blood corticosterone levels, 2) adult locomotion and anxiety behavior, and 3) region-specific differences in endogenous TrkB full-length (TrkB.FL) and truncated (TrkB.T1) receptor isoforms. Blood collected on days 1, 5 and 10 revealed elevated basal and stress-induced CORT secretion in females compared to males, while ANA-12 attenuated CORT elevations post stress in both sexes. As adults, all females exhibit higher locomotor and exploratory activity than males in the open field test and elevated plus maze, and differences were comparable in the forced swim within stress-naïve and stress groups. Biochemically, vehicle-treated males showed elevated TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL compared to vehicle-treated females in the PFC, hippocampus and NAc, and levels were consistently attenuated by ANA-12 treatment in non-stress males. With regards to stress exposure, expression of both isoforms was strongly down-regulated in the NAc of males only and was associated with increased TrkB.T1 in the PFC. ANA-12 enhanced expression in females, independent of stress exposure, compared to vehicle-treated counterparts, expression being increased for TrkB.T1 versus TrkB.FL and magnitude of the changes being region-specific. In contrast, ANA-12 effects in stressed males were restricted to inhibition of both isoforms in the hippocampus. Together, our findings support that TrkB activation, contingent on stress exposure, differentially affects TrkB isoform regulation during adulthood. Sex-specific biochemical responses at delayed intervals following adolescent stress exposure further support the need to include the sex variable in animal models.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Azogu, Idu, I|Liang, Jacky, J|Plamondon, Helene, H','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(54,6,29752662,'1573-3327','Executive Attention and Empathy-Related Responses in Boys with Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder, With and Without Comorbid Anxiety Disorder.','This is a first study that investigated the relationships between executive attention-as an important aspect of emotion regulation-and state empathy and sympathy in ODD/CD boys with (N = 31) and without (N = 18) comorbid anxiety disorder (7-12 years).

Two hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme\'s impact on the participants\' lives, diet and health.

These results suggest that TCI-R could offer a valuable dimensional method for predicting the risk of anxiety disorders in diverse depressed patients.','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Paavonen, Vesa, V|Luoto, Kaisa, K|Lassila, Antero, A|Leinonen, Esa, E|Kampman, Olli, O','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(59,6,29751238,'1573-2517','Prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among youth with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.','The purpose of this meta-analytic study was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of anxiety and depressive disorders among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) and to assess the extent to which these pooled prevalence rates differed according to studies\' characteristics.A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases and 21 studies, published between 1975 and 2015, met the inclusion criteria.The resulting pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety and depressive disorders were respectively (a) 5.4% and 2.8% across samples; (b) 1.2% and 0.03% among children; and (c) 7.9% and 1.4% among adolescents.

The HD group reported more impairment than did the HC group in domains of memory, distractibility, blunders, memory for names, and inattention. These differences generally remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. In the HD group, the degree of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with severity of saving and acquiring behaviors, although results were attenuated when controlling for comorbid symptoms (overall HD severity, but not saving behavior specifically, remained significantly correlated with cognitive impairment). Subjective cognitive impairment was further associated with a desire to save possessions in order to avoid forgetting, and these results remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms.

The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and incidence of PADs in patients suffering from parietal lobe gliomas through a prospective study and a battery of comprehensive neuropsychological tests. METHODS Between 2012 and 2016 the authors recruited 38 patients with glioma confined in the parietal lobe. Patients were examined for primary and secondary association deficits with a dedicated battery of neuropsychological tests. The PADs were grouped into 5 categories: visuospatial attention, gnosis, praxis, upper-limb coordination, and language. For descriptive analysis tumors were divided into high- and low-grade gliomas and also according to patient age and tumor size. RESULTS Parietal association deficits were elicited in 80% of patients, thus being more common than primary deficits (50%). Apraxia was the most common PAD (47.4%), followed by anomic aphasia and subcomponents of Gerstmann\'s syndrome (34.2% each). Other deficits such as hemineglect, stereoagnosia, extinction, and visuomotor ataxia were also detected, albeit at lower rates. There was a statistically nonsignificant difference between PADs and sex (72.2% males, 85% females) and age (77.8% at ≤ 60 years, 80% at age > 60 years), but a statistically significant difference between the > 4 cm and the ≤ 4 cm diameter group (p = 0.02, 94.7% vs 63.2%, respectively). There was a tendency (p = 0.094) for low-grade gliomas to present with fewer PADs (50%) than high-grade gliomas (85.7%). Tumor laterality showed a strong correlation with hemineglect (p = 0.004, predilection for right hemisphere), anomia (p = 0.001), and Gerstmann\'s symptoms (p = 0.01); the last 2 deficits showed a left (dominant) hemispheric preponderance. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to prospectively evaluate the incidence and nature of PADs in patients with parietal gliomas. It could be that the current literature may have underestimated the true incidence of deficits. Dedicated neuropsychological examination detects a high frequency of PADs, the most common being apraxia, followed by anomia and subcomponents of Gerstmann\'s syndrome. Nevertheless, a direct correlation between the clinical deficit and its anatomical substrate is only possible to a limited extent, highlighting the need for intraoperative cortical and subcortical functional mapping.','2018-05-04 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00',0,0,'Liouta, Evangelia, E|Stranjalis, George, G|Kalyvas, Aristotelis V, AV|Koutsarnakis, Christos, C|Pantinaki, Stavroula, S|Liakos, Faidon, F|Komaitis, Spyros, S|Stavrinou, Lampis C, LC','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(62,7,29722099,'1097-0193','Deficient supplementary motor area at rest: Neural basis of limb kinetic deficits in Parkinson\'s disease.','Parkinson\'s disease (PD) patients frequently suffer from limb kinetic apraxia (LKA) affecting quality of life. LKA denotes an impairment of precise and independent finger movements beyond bradykinesia, which is reliably assessed by coin rotation (CR) task. BOLD fMRI detected activation of a left inferior parietal-premotor praxis network in PD during CR. Here, we explored which network site is most critical for LKA using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Based on a hierarchical model, we hypothesized that LKA would predominantly affect the functional integrity of premotor areas including supplementary motor areas (SMA). Furthermore, we suspected that for praxis function with higher demand on temporal-spatial processing such as gesturing, inferior parietal lobule (IPL) upstream to premotor areas would be essential. A total of 21 PD patients and 20 healthy controls underwent ASL acquisition during rest. Behavioral assessment outside the scanner involved the CR, finger tapping task, and the test of upper limb apraxia (TULIA). Whole-brain analysis of activity at rest showed a significant reduction of CR-related perfusion in the left SMA of PD. Furthermore, the positive correlation between SMA perfusion and CR, seen in controls, was lost in patients. By contrast, TULIA was significantly associated with the perfusion of left IPL in both patients and controls. In conclusion, the findings suggest that LKA in PD are linked to an intrinsic disruption of the left SMA function, which may only be overcome by compensatory network activation. In addition, gestural performance relies on IPL which remains available for functional recruitment in early PD.','2018-05-02 00:00:00','2018-05-02 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00',0,0,'Kübel, Stefanie, S|Stegmayer, Katharina, K|Vanbellingen, Tim, T|Walther, Sebastian, S|Bohlhalter, Stephan, S','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(63,7,29713440,'2040-2295','Social Robotics in Therapy of Apraxia of Speech.','Apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder in which messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted, resulting in an inability for moving lips or tongue to the right place to pronounce sounds correctly.

In contrast, the function and value knowledge tasks resulted in a significant strengthening of the effective connectivity between visual cortex and fusiform gyrus. Importantly, this modulation was present in both semantic tasks, indicating that processing different aspects of semantic knowledge about tools evokes similar effective connectivity patterns. Data revealed that interregional effective connectivity during the processing of tool knowledge occurred in a bidirectional manner with a weakening of connectivity between areas engaged in action and semantic knowledge about tools during the processing of action knowledge.

Mokken Scaling analyses were used to examine item structure and consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify predictors of the amount (number of asthma care activities HCPs delivered) and consistency (the degree to which HCPs deliver similar care) of asthma medical care and self-management support.On average, HCPs reported delivering 74,2% of guideline-recommended care. Consistency of medical care and self-management support was lower among HCPs delivering a lower amount of care (r=.58 and r=.57, p<.001). UK HCPs provided more and more consistent asthma self-management support -but not medical care- than French HCPs, which was explained by the presence of practice nurses in the UK.

Clinical studies directly comparing SCIT and SLIT report a different kinetics and magnitude of immunological changes induced during treatment. Comparative studies into the mechanisms underlying immune suppression in SCIT and SLIT are lacking.We aimed to establish an experimental model for grass pollen (GP) SCIT and SLIT that would allow a head-to-head comparison of the two treatments.Balb/c mice were sensitized with GP-extract, followed by SCIT and SLIT treatments with various GP dosages. Subsequently, we challenged mice with GP and measured airway responsiveness (AHR), GP-specific immunoglobulins, ear-swelling tests (EST), eosinophilic inflammation in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and T-cell cytokine release after re-stimulation of lung cells (IL-5, -10, and -13).We find that SLIT treatment was able to suppress allergen-induced AHR, while allergic inflammation was not effectively suppressed even at the highest GP dose in this model. In contrast, SCIT treatment induced higher levels of GP-specific IgG1, while SLIT was superior in inducing a GP-specific IgG2a response, which was associated with increased Th1 activity in lung tissue after SLIT, but not SCIT treatment. Interestingly, SCIT was able to suppress Th2-type cytokine production in lung cell suspensions, while SLIT failed to do so.In conclusion, GP-SCIT suppresses Th2 inflammation and induced neutralizing antibodies, while GP-SLIT suppresses the clinically relevant lung function parameters in an asthma mouse model, indicating that the two application routes depend on partially divergent mechanisms of tolerance induction. Interestingly, these data mirror observations in clinical studies, underscoring the translational value of these mouse models. This article is protected by copyright.

The study was based on the survey data retrospectively retrieved from the Action Health-Lung Cancer Prophylaxis and Health Care Improvement screening program that concerned all the inhabitants, aged over 40, of the Proszowice administrative region situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland. Participants with the symptoms suggestive of a lung disease were subject to further evaluation. The findings were that 546 (13.3%) out of the 4105 individuals displayed spirometry features of COPD. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 92 (16.8%) out of the COPD afflicted persons. Chronic bronchitis was commoner in current smokers and its incidence increased with increasing severity of airway obstruction. In multivariate analysis, chronic bronchitis was independently related to lower FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and to dyspnea. In regression model, factors related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis were current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function. We conclude that COPD with coexisting chronic bronchitis is linked to severer dyspnea and worse lung function. Current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function are related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis accompanying COPD.','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Mejza, Filip, F|Nastałek, Paweł, P|Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka, A|Doniec, Zbigniew, Z|Skucha, Wojciech, W','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(74,8,29752613,'1672-0415','Immune Homeostasis: Effects of Chinese Herbal Formulae and Herb-Derived Compounds on Allergic Asthma in Different Experimental Models.','Allergic asthma is thought to arise from an imbalance of immune regulation, which is characterized by the production of large quantities of IgE antibodies by B cells and a decrease of the interferon-γ/interleukin-4 (Th1/Th2) ratio. Certain immunomodulatory components and Chinese herbal formulae have been used in traditional herbal medicine for thousands of years. However, there are few studies performing evidence-based Chinese medicine (CM) research on the mechanisms and effificacy of these drugs in allergic asthma. This review aims to explore the roles of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived compounds in experimental research models of allergic asthma. We screened published modern CM research results on the experimental effects of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds for allergic asthma and their possible underlying mechanisms in English language articles from the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases with the keywords allergic asthma, experimental model and Chinese herbal medicine. We found 22 Chinese herb species and 31 herb-derived anti-asthmatic compounds as well as 12 Chinese herbal formulae which showed a reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergen-specifific immunoglobulin E, inflflammatory cell infifiltration and a regulation of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Chinese herbal formulae and herbderived bioactive compounds exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflflammatory and anti-asthma activities in different experimental models and their various mechanisms of action are being investigated in modern CM research with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics technologies, which will lead to a new era in the development of new drug discovery for allergic asthma in CM.','2018-05-01 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Liu, Lu, L|Wang, Lin-Peng, LP|He, Shan, S|Ma, Yan, Y','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(75,8,29752346,'1468-3296','Rates of asthma exacerbations and mortality and associated factors in Uganda: a 2-year prospective cohort study.','Data on asthma treatment outcomes in Africa are limited. 449 patients with asthma (age 5-93 years) in Uganda were followed up for 2 years to determine rates of exacerbations and mortality and associated factors.

Considering only the first year of follow-up, 59.6% of the patients experienced at least one exacerbation, 32.4% experienced three or more exacerbations. A multivariable model showed that the likelihood of experiencing at least one exacerbation in the first year of follow-up was lower with better baseline asthma control (higher asthma control test (ACT) score), with OR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.93, P=0.000), and was higher with more exacerbations in the year prior to enrolment (OR for log number of exacerbations 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.57, P=0.018).

Information on asthma prevalence in the Middle East is fragmented and relatively out-dated. The SNAPSHOT program was conducted to obtain updated information.SNAPSHOT is a cross-sectional epidemiological program carried out in five Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, the latter three grouped into a Gulf cluster) to collect data on asthma, allergic rhinitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and bipolar disorder. The survey was carried out by telephone in a random sample of the adult general population with quotas defined according to country demographics. The analysis presented in this paper focuses on asthma. Subjects were screened for asthma based on criteria from the global Asthma Insights and Reality studies. Current prevalence (last 12 months) was estimated. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors related to asthma and the association with allergic rhinitis and other co-morbidities. Quality of life was assessed using the three-level EQ-5D questionnaire.2124 out of the 33,486 subjects enrolled in the SNAPSHOT program fulfilled the criteria for asthma. The adjusted prevalence of asthma ranged from 4.4% [95% CI: 4.0-4.8%] in Turkey, to 6.7% [95% CI: 6.2-7.2%] in Egypt and 7.6% [95% CI: 7.1-8.0%] in the Gulf cluster. Prevalence was higher (p < 0.0001) in women than men and increased with age (p < 0.0001). Co-morbidities occurred more frequently in asthma subjects compared to the non-asthma population (38% vs. 15% p < 0.0001).

Immunization with aluminum adjuvants, as with helminth infection, induces a Th2 type cell mediated immune response, including eosinophilia, but does not induce an environment conducive to the induction of regulatory mechanisms. Helminths play a role in what is known as the hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that decreased exposure to microbes during a critical time in early life has resulted in the increased prevalence and morbidity of asthma and atopic disorders over the past few decades, especially in Western countries. In addition, gut and lung microbiome composition and their interaction with the immune system plays an important role in a properly regulated immune system. Disturbances in microbiome composition are a risk factor for asthma and allergies. We propose that immunization with aluminum adjuvants in general is not favorable for induction of regulatory mechanisms and, in the context of the hygiene hypothesis and microbiome theory, can be viewed as an amplifying factor and significant contributing risk factor for allergic diseases, especially in a genetically susceptible subpopulation.','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Terhune, Todd D, TD|Deth, Richard C, RC','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(79,8,29750604,'1741-0541','Pharmacogenomic test that predicts response to β-agonists in adults with asthma is cost effective.','Pharmacogenomic tests that predict which asthma patients are likely to respond to β-agonists hold promise to improve care for asthma.To identify the clinical and economic circumstances under which a pharmacogenomic test that predicts response to β-agonists might or might not be an appropriate, cost-effective option.We synthesized published data on clinical and economic outcomes in adults 18-35 to project 10-year costs, quality-adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response.Pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response conferred a cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with no testing.Pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response in individuals with asthma is potentially cost effective and should be pursued by test developers.','2015-11-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Wu, Ann Chen, AC|Gay, Charlene, C|Rett, Melisa D, MD|Fuhlbrigge, Anne L, AL','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(80,8,29749828,'1741-0541','Candidate gene analysis of asthma in a population of Arab descent: a case-control study in Jordan.','To evaluate whether SNPs (n = 15) in ten candidate genes (ADRB2, ADH5, ARGI, CRHR1, STIP1, LTA4H, LTC4S, ALOX5, ABCC1 and OATP2B1) are associated with asthma in Jordanian population of Arab descent.A case-control study included 245 adult asthmatics and 249 controls.Significant genetic association was identified at the rs2236647 (T/C) SNP in STIP1 and risk of asthma (p < 0.001).

Here we present a co-formulation of an antitoxin to the three most important serotypes. Combining these antibodies obviates the need to identify the serotype causing intoxication prior to drug administration, which would facilitate administration. The lyophilized powder formulation contains nine mAbs, three mAbs for each of the three serotypes (A, B, E).

No significant increase in soluble higher order aggregates, cleavage products, or change in charge isoforms was measured after storage as a lyophilized powder at 50°C for one year. Furthermore, toxin-domain binding ELISA data indicated that each of the individual antibodies in the lyophilized drug product showed essentially full binding capability to their respective toxin domains after being stored at 50°C for one year.

This paper reviews published literature about microbial hazards, plant toxins, and chemical hazards. Microbial hazards include Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, and various mold species. High concentrations of C. botulinum in silage have been associated with cattle botulism. A high initial concentration of C. botulinum spores in forage in combination with poor silage fermentation conditions can promote the growth of C. botulinum in silage. The elevated pH level that is generally associated with aerobic deterioration of silage is a major factor influencing concentrations of L. monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and molds in silage and may also encourage survival and growth of M. bovis, the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis. Soil is a major source of B. cereus spores in silage; growth of this bacterium in silage appears to be limited. Hazards from plant toxins include pyrrolizidine, tropane and tropolone alkaloids, phytoestrogens, prussic acid, and mimosine, compounds that exist naturally in certain plant species that may contaminate forages at harvesting. Another group of toxins belonging to this category are ergot alkaloids, which are produced by endophytic fungal species in forages such as tall fescue grass, sorghum, and ryegrass. Varying effects of ensiling on the degradation of these plant toxins have been reported. Chemical hazards include nitrate, nitrite, and toxic oxide gases of nitrogen produced from nitrate and high levels of butyric acid, biogenic amines, and ammonia. Chemical and microbiological hazards are associated with poorly fermented silages, which can be avoided by using proper silage-making practices and creating conditions that promote a rapid and sufficient reduction of the silage pH and prevent aerobic deterioration.','2018-05-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-04-24 00:00:00',0,0,'Driehuis, F, F|Wilkinson, J M, JM|Jiang, Y, Y|Ogunade, I, I|Adesogan, A T, AT','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(87,9,29678457,'1095-8274','Erratum to \"Investigation of Clostridium botulinum group III\'s mobilome content\" [Anaerobe 49 (2018) 71-77].','No abstract found.','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-04-21 00:00:00',0,0,'Woudstra, Cédric, C|Le Maréchal, Caroline, C|Souillard, Rozenn, R|Anniballi, Fabrizio, F|Auricchio, Bruna, B|Bano, Luca, L|Bayon-Auboyer, Marie-Hélène, MH|Koene, Miriam, M|Mermoud, Isabelle, I|Brito, Roseane B, RB|Lobato, Francisco C F, FCF|Silva, Rodrigo O S, ROS|Dorner, Martin B, MB|Fach, Patrick, P','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(88,9,29677267,'1539-3704','The Short-Lived Epidemic of Botulism From Commercially Canned Foods in the United States, 1919 to 1925.','In 1919, three deadly outbreaks of botulism caused by consumption of canned olives packed in California captured national headlines. In all of the outbreaks, which occurred in separate locales, unsuspecting people died after consuming tainted food during a banquet or family meal. The press\'s sensational portrayal of canned food as hazardous aroused alarm among consumers at a time when commercial canning was becoming more common. Intent on restoring the image of their product as safe and wholesome, canning industry leaders funded a \"botulism commission\" of scientific experts in 1919 to investigate how to systematically eliminate the threat of botulism that had imperiled their business. The commissioners identified the scientific reasons for the outbreaks, and on the basis of their findings, the California Department of Public Health issued explicit recommendations for sterilization procedures intended to ensure safety. However, the department did not mandate inspections for all canneries. When commercially packed fruits and vegetables continued to cause botulism, industry leaders voluntarily backed a cannery inspection act to legally require all California canners to possess appropriate equipment and follow scientifically validated sterilization procedures. After the California legislature approved the act in 1925, canneries were inspected, regulations were enforced, and no further outbreaks occurred. This botulism epidemic is an example of a disease outbreak that was controlled when business interests became aligned with public health goals. The press\'s portrayal of afflicted persons as innocent victims and worthy citizens galvanized businessmen to implement safeguards to protect consumers from botulism intoxication.

Herein, using Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antagonist)-responsive genes along with transcriptomics of synovial tissue from multiple stages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease progression, we have interrogated the activity status of PD-1 pathway during RA development. We demonstrate that the expression of PD-1 was increased in early and established RA synovial tissue compared to normal and OA synovium, whereas that of its ligands, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, was increased at all the stages of RA disease progression, namely arthralgia, IA/undifferentiated arthritis, early RA and established RA. Further, we show that RA patients expressed PD-1 on a majority of synovial tissue infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, enrichment of Nivolumab gene signature was observed in IA and RA, indicating that the PD-1 pathway was downregulated during RA disease progression. Furthermore, serum soluble (s) PD-1 levels were increased in autoantibody positive early RA patients. Interestingly, most of the early RA synovium tissue sections showed negative PD-L1 staining by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, downregulation in PD-1 inhibitory signaling in RA could be attributed to increased serum sPD-1 and decreased synovial tissue PD-L1 levels. Taken together, these data suggest that agonistic PD1 antibody-based therapeutics may show efficacy in RA treatment and interception.','2018-05-13 00:00:00','2018-02-28 00:00:00','2018-04-06 00:00:00',0,0,'Guo, Yanxia, Y|Walsh, Alice M, AM|Canavan, Mary, M|Wechalekar, Mihir D, MD|Cole, Suzanne, S|Yin, Xuefeng, X|Scott, Brittney, B|Loza, Mathew, M|Orr, Carl, C|McGarry, Trudy, T|Bombardieri, Michele, M|Humby, Frances, F|Proudman, Susanna M, SM|Pitzalis, Costantino, C|Smith, Malcolm D, MD|Friedman, Joshua R, JR|Anderson, Ian, I|Madakamutil, Loui, L|Veale, Douglas J, DJ|Fearon, Ursula, U|Nagpal, Sunil, S','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(91,10,29456021,'1525-0024','Brain Nat8l Knockdown Suppresses Spongiform Leukodystrophy in an Aspartoacylase-Deficient Canavan Disease Mouse Model.','Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy caused by loss-of-function ASPA mutations, is characterized by brain dysmyelination, vacuolation, and astrogliosis (\"spongiform leukodystrophy\"). ASPA encodes aspartoacylase, an oligodendroglial enzyme that cleaves the abundant brain amino acid N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) to L-aspartate and acetate. Aspartoacylase deficiency results in a 50% or greater elevation in brain NAA concentration ([NAA]). Prior studies showed that homozygous constitutive knockout of Nat8l, the gene encoding the neuronal NAA synthesizing enzyme N-acetyltransferase 8-like, prevents aspartoacylase-deficient mice from developing spongiform leukodystrophy. We now report that brain Nat8l knockdown elicited by intracerebroventricular/intracisternal administration of an adeno-associated viral vector carrying a short hairpin Nat8l inhibitory RNA to neonatal aspartoacylase-deficient Aspa mice lowers [NAA] and suppresses development of spongiform leukodystrophy.','2018-03-07 00:00:00','2018-01-10 00:00:00','2018-04-25 00:00:00',0,0,'Bannerman, Peter, P|Guo, Fuzheng, F|Chechneva, Olga, O|Burns, Travis, T|Zhu, Xiaoqing, X|Wang, Yan, Y|Kim, Bokyung, B|Singhal, Naveen K, NK|McDonough, Jennifer A, JA|Pleasure, David, D','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(92,10,29453510,'1573-2665','Next-generation metabolic screening: targeted and untargeted metabolomics for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in individual patients.','The implementation of whole-exome sequencing in clinical diagnostics has generated a need for functional evaluation of genetic variants. In the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), a diverse spectrum of targeted biochemical assays is employed to analyze a limited amount of metabolites. We now present a single-platform, high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) method that can be applied for holistic metabolic profiling in plasma of individual IEM-suspected patients. This method, which we termed \"next-generation metabolic screening\" (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample. In the NGMS workflow, features identified in patient and control samples are aligned using the \"various forms of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS)\" software package. Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted setting, which we term \"open the metabolome\" analysis. This approach identifies potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory diagnostics of IEMs.','2018-02-16 00:00:00','2018-02-16 00:00:00','2018-02-17 00:00:00',0,0,'Coene, Karlien L M, KLM|Kluijtmans, Leo A J, LAJ|van der Heeft, Ed, E|Engelke, Udo F H, UFH|de Boer, Siebolt, S|Hoegen, Brechtje, B|Kwast, Hanneke J T, HJT|van de Vorst, Maartje, M|Huigen, Marleen C D G, MCDG|Keularts, Irene M L W, IMLW|Schreuder, Michiel F, MF|van Karnebeek, Clara D M, CDM|Wortmann, Saskia B, SB|de Vries, Maaike C, MC|Janssen, Mirian C H, MCH|Gilissen, Christian, C|Engel, Jasper, J|Wevers, Ron A, RA','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(93,10,29401083,'1536-4801','Molecular Comparison of Adult and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Indicates Broad Similarity of Molecular Pathways in Disease Tissue.','Efficacy data from adult ulcerative colitis (UC) clinical trials are often extrapolated for pediatric prescribing.

Toxic NAA accumulation appears to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan disease-a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading enzyme aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for this spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target tissue and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan disease, abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the spectrum, while predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased brain NAA levels are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice overexpressing the NAA synthesising enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA levels were uncoupled from neurological deficits. In contrast, elimination of aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes elicited Canavan disease like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion in oligodendrocytes abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase in peripheral organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and ameliorate histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and complete aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting oligodendrocytes in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS pathology and lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first successful post-symptomatic treatment of a white matter disorder using an adeno-associated virus vector tailored towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene expression.','2018-01-01 00:00:00','2017-11-07 00:00:00','2018-01-23 00:00:00',0,0,'von Jonquieres, Georg, G|Spencer, Ziggy H T, ZHT|Rowlands, Benjamin D, BD|Klugmann, Claudia B, CB|Bongers, Andre, A|Harasta, Anne E, AE|Parley, Kristina E, KE|Cederholm, Jennie, J|Teahan, Orla, O|Pickford, Russell, R|Delerue, Fabien, F|Ittner, Lars M, LM|Fröhlich, Dominik, D|McLean, Catriona A, CA|Don, Anthony S, AS|Schneider, Miriam, M|Housley, Gary D, GD|Rae, Caroline D, CD|Klugmann, Matthias, M','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13');

It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats. These fats build up in the brain. They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves. This can cause seizures and hyperactivity. It can also cause problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy). ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0). The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. Treatment options for ALD are limited. Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo\'s oil. For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course. Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated. ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.

The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and lasts for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes. The cause of agoraphobia is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5 agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. Those affected are at higher risk of depression and substance use disorder. Without treatment it is uncommon for agoraphobia to resolve. Treatment is typically with a type of counselling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT results in resolution for about half of people. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of adults. Women are affected about twice as often as men. The condition often begins in early adulthood and becomes less common in old age. It is rare in children.

These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. Common allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body\'s immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person\'s medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear. Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, about 6% of people have at least one food allergy, and about 20% have atopic dermatitis at some point in time.

The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development. As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome. AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Androgen_receptor_3-d_model.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(6,'Anxiety disorder',57688,744602293,'DOID_2030','Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder. The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, a family history of mental disorders, and poverty. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other psychiatric and medical problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine , alcohol or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs. Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioural therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may improve symptoms. About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year. They occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common are specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life. They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/The_Scream.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety_disorder','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(7,'Apraxia',56458,744656988,'DOID_0060135','Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex), in which the individual has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked, provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task.

It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person they may become worse at night or with exercise. Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. There is no cure for asthma. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required. In 2013, 242 million people globally had asthma up from 183 million in 1990. It caused about 489,000 deaths in 2013, most of which occurred in the developing world. It often begins in childhood. The rates of asthma have increased significantly since the 1960s. Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt. The word asthma is from the Greek ἅσθμα, ásthma which means \"panting\".','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Two_Peak_Flow_Meters.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asthma','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(9,'Botulism',40142,744523470,'DOID_11976','Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, botulus, meaning sausage.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Botulism1and2.JPG?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Botulism','2018-05-13 21:01:13','2018-05-13 21:01:13'),(10,'Canavan disease',56461,745014362,'DOID_3613','Canavan disease, also called Canavan-Van Bogaert-Bertrand disease, is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder that causes progressive damage to nerve cells in the brain, and is one of the most common degenerative cerebral diseases of infancy.
