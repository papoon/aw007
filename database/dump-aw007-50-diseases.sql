The aim of this study was to measure submaximal [Formula: see text]O and C during a range of set walking speeds (SWS; 0.56 - 1.94 m⋅s, increment 0.28 m⋅s), set running speeds (SRS; 1.67 - 3.33 m⋅s, increment 0.28 m⋅s) and a self-selected walking speed (SSW). [Formula: see text]O and C was scaled to total body mass (TBM) and fat free mass (FFM) while gait speed was scaled to leg length using Froude\'s number (Fr). Achondroplasic [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O were on average 29 and 35% greater during SWS ( < 0.05) and 12 and 18% higher during SRS ( < 0.05) than controls, respectively. Achondroplasic C and C were 29 and 33% greater during SWS ( < 0.05) and 12 and 18% greater during SRS ( < 0.05) than controls, respectively. There was no difference in SSW [Formula: see text]O or [Formula: see text]O between groups ( > 0.05), but C and C at SSW were 23 and 29% higher ( < 0.05) in the Achondroplasic group compared to controls, respectively. [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O correlated with Fr for both groups ( = 0.984 - 0.999,  < 0.05). Leg length accounted for the majority of the higher [Formula: see text]O and [Formula: see text]O in the Achondroplasic group, but further work is required to explain the higher Achondroplasic C and C at all speeds compared to controls.  There is a leftward shift of oxygen consumption scaled to total body mass and fat free mass in Achondroplasic adults when walking and running. This is nullified when talking into account leg length. However, despite these scalars, Achondroplasic individuals have a higher walking and metabolic cost compared to age matched non-Achondroplasic individuals, suggesting biomechanical differences between the groups.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-05-07 00:00:00',0,0,'Sims, David T, DT|Onambélé-Pearson, Gladys L, GL|Burden, Adrian, A|Payton, Carl, C|Morse, Christopher I, CI','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(2,1,29681095,'1552-4833','Further delineation of achondroplasia-hypochondroplasia complex with long-term survival.','Achondroplasia-hypochondroplasia (ACH-HCH) complex is caused by the presence of two different pathogenic variants in each allele of FGFR3 gene.

While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0-3], [4-8] and [9-18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (Fgfr3ach/+) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating Fgfr3ach/+ mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-04-13 00:00:00','2018-04-29 00:00:00',0,0,'Saint-Laurent, Celine, C|Garcia, Stephanie, S|Sarrazy, Vincent, V|Dumas, Karine, K|Authier, Florence, F|Sore, Sophie, S|Tran, Albert, A|Gual, Philippe, P|Gennero, Isabelle, I|Salles, Jean-Pierre, JP|Gouze, Elvire, E','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(4,1,29622960,'2090-911X','A case of multivessel PTCA in achondroplasia patient.','No abstract found.','2017-03-01 00:00:00','2016-03-15 00:00:00','2018-04-08 00:00:00',0,0,'Kumar, Viveka, V|Kumar, Vivek, V','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(5,1,29593476,'1661-8769','Novel and Recurrent Mutations in the  Gene and Double Heterozygosity Cases in a Cohort of Brazilian Patients with Skeletal Dysplasia.','Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene () cause achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), and thanatophoric dysplasia types I and II (TDI/TDII).

One of them had a classical TDI phenotype but a typical ACH mutation (c.1138G>A) in combination with a novel c.1130T>C mutation predicted as being pathogenic. The presence of the second c.1130T>C mutation likely explained the more severe phenotype. Another atypical patient presented with a compound phenotype that resulted from a combination of ACH and X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (OMIM 313400).

This mutation induces dysfunction of the growth cartilage, leading to abnormalities in the development of trabecular bone. Because the mutation is autosomal dominant, these perinates have a 50% risk of having been affected. This study determines whether trabecular bone microarchitecture (TBMA) analysis is useful for detecting genetic dwarfism. Proximal metaphyses of humeri were μCT-scanned with a resolution of 7-12 μm.

Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques; oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-Hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Mutation information and molecular markers investigated to date are not predictive of conversion. Prior reports have focused on toxic metabolic byproducts and reactive oxygen species as instigators of cerebral inflammation and subsequent immune cell invasion leading to BBB breakdown. This study focuses on the BBB itself and evaluates differences in brain endothelium integrity using cells from ccALD patients and wild-type (WT) controls.The blood-brain barrier of ccALD patients and WT controls was modeled using directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs). Immunocytochemistry and PCR confirmed characteristic expression of brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) markers. Barrier properties of iBMECs were measured via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), sodium fluorescein permeability, and frayed junction analysis. Electron microscopy and RNA-seq were used to further characterize disease-specific differences. Oil-Red-O staining was used to quantify differences in lipid accumulation. To evaluate whether treatment with block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) (PEO-PPO) could mitigate defective properties, ccALD-iBMECs were treated with PEO-PPO block copolymers and their barrier properties and lipid accumulation levels were quantified.iBMECs from patients with ccALD had significantly decreased TEER (2592 ± 110 Ω cm) compared to WT controls (5001 ± 172 Ω cm). They also accumulated lipid droplets to a greater extent than WT-iBMECs. Upon treatment with a PEO-PPO diblock copolymer during the differentiation process, an increase in TEER and a reduction in lipid accumulation were observed for the polymer treated ccALD-iBMECs compared to untreated controls.The finding that BBB integrity is decreased in ccALD and can be rescued with block copolymers opens the door for the discovery of BBB-specific molecular markers that can indicate the onset of ccALD and has therapeutic implications for preventing the conversion to ccALD.','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Lee, Catherine A A, CAA|Seo, Hannah S, HS|Armien, Anibal G, AG|Bates, Frank S, FS|Tolar, Jakub, J|Azarin, Samira M, SM','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(21,3,29751240,'1573-2517','Temperament clusters associate with anxiety disorder comorbidity in depression.','Individual temperament is associated with psychiatric morbidity and could explain differences in psychiatric comorbidities.

It is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology consider antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Several classes of antidepressants have been studied and compared, but it is still unclear which antidepressants have a more or less favourable profile in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of this condition.To assess the effects of antidepressants for panic disorder in adults, specifically:1. to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison to placebo;2. to review the acceptability of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo; and3. to investigate the adverse effects of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, including the general prevalence of adverse effects, compared to placebo.We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders\' (CCMD) Specialised Register, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to May 2017.

We entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and settings. Primary outcomes included failure to respond, measured by a range of response scales, and treatment acceptability, measured by total number of dropouts for any reason. Secondary outcomes included failure to remit, panic symptom scales, frequency of panic attacks, agoraphobia, general anxiety, depression, social functioning, quality of life and patient satisfaction, measured by various scales as defined in individual studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one unique RCTs including 9377 participants overall, of whom we included 8252 in the 49 placebo-controlled arms of interest (antidepressant as monotherapy and placebo alone) in this review. The majority of studies were of moderate to low quality due to inconsistency, imprecision and unclear risk of selection and performance bias.We found low-quality evidence that revealed a benefit for antidepressants as a group in comparison with placebo in terms of efficacy measured as failure to respond (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.79; participants = 6500; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 6 to 9): that means seven people would need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. We observed the same finding when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo.Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit for antidepressants compared to placebo when looking at number of dropouts due to any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; participants = 7850; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a NNTB of 27 (95% CI 17 to 105); treating 27 people will result in one person fewer dropping out. Considering antidepressant classes, TCAs showed a benefit over placebo, while for SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) we observed no difference.When looking at dropouts due to adverse effects, which can be considered as a measure of tolerability, we found moderate-quality evidence showing that antidepressants as a whole are less well tolerated than placebo. In particular, TCAs and SSRIs produced more dropouts due to adverse effects in comparison with placebo, while the confidence interval for SNRI, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and other antidepressants were wide and included the possibility of no difference.The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review.Based on these results, antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder. Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7, implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with placebo in terms of number of dropouts, but a less favourable profile in terms of dropout due to adverse effects. However, the tolerability profile varied between different classes of antidepressants.The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice cannot be made on the basis of this review.Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies, and only assessing short-term outcomes.Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Bighelli, Irene, I|Castellazzi, Mariasole, M|Cipriani, Andrea, A|Girlanda, Francesca, F|Guaiana, Giuseppe, G|Koesters, Markus, M|Turrini, Giulia, G|Furukawa, Toshi A, TA|Barbui, Corrado, C','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(27,3,29592527,'1360-0451','The association between HIV clinical disease severity and psychiatric disorders as seen in Western Romania.','HIV disease continues to be a serious health issue all over the world. By the end of 2016, 36.7 million people were living with HIV, 1.8 million people became newly infected and 1 million died of HIV-related causes/diseases. In order to develop effective treatment strategies, is important to assess the risk factors that affect negatively the HIV-positive patients. HIV-infected patients are at high risk of developing psychiatric disorders in every stage of the illness. Psychiatric disorders can negatively influence the treatment adherence, induce risk behavior and influence the quality of life. The purpose of this study is to determine if the severity of HIV disease is associated with increased frequency of psychiatric disorders. We evaluated 101 HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Western Romania via Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). We conducted a risk analysis in order to see if the patients have a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders depending on HIV serostatus factor (HIV asymptomatic, symptomatic, AIDS converted). Our study shows that, the patients having AIDS and symptomatic HIV have a higher prevalence for the most common psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (OR = 5.81;p < 0.001), panic disorder (OR = 3.11; p = 0.016), agoraphobia (OR = 4.31; p = 0.024), social phobia (OR = 2.81; p = 0.038), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.79; p = 0.006), somatization (OR = 8.72; p < 0.0010) and hypochondria (OR = 4.66; p = 0.0013). Symptomatic HIV and AIDS converted serostatus is also a risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and psychosis. The main conclusion of this study is that the more severe HIV clinical disease was associated with increased frequency of psychiatric disorders. As a consequence, we conclude that psychiatric disorders and HIV/AIDS treatment should be addressed simultaneously, depending on the risk specific factors such as the HIV infection stage and, due to psychiatric repercussions of HIV is expected to become more relevant in the coming years.','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-29 00:00:00',0,0,'Ursoiu, Fulvia, F|Moleriu, Lavinia, L|Lungeanu, Diana, D|Puschită, Maria, M','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(28,3,29580906,'2213-0276','Post-traumatic psychiatric disorders: PTSD is not the only diagnosis.','Traumatic events and their consequences are often hidden or minimised by patients for reasons linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder itself (inexpressibility, shame, depressive thoughts, fear of stigmatisation, etc.). Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains the most widely known disorder, chronic post-traumatic psychiatric disorders are many and varied. After a trauma, the practitioner has to check for the different clinical forms of post-traumatic psychological consequences: PTSD is not the only diagnosis. Based on our own clinical experience compared to the international literature, we think necessary to build a didactic classification describing chronic post-traumatic symptoms and syndromes. Post traumatic depressions and bereavement lead to high risk of suicidal crisis and self-harm behaviours. Re-experiencing are felt with anxiety, hyper arousal increases anxious reactivity, and avoidance strategies increase anticipatory anxiety, indicating post-traumatic anxiety disorders (agoraphobia, specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, social phobia). Characterising an often-severe clinical picture, the co-occurrence of post-traumatic and chronic psychotic symptoms is not unusual (post-traumatic schizophrenia, post-traumatic depression with mood-congruent psychotic features, non-schizophrenic post-traumatic psychotic disorder, and bipolar reaction to trauma). A physical injury occurring at the same time as a traumatic exposure increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder later which, in turn, afflicts the subjective perception of the physical health (development of somatoform and psychosomatic disorders, comorbidity with a post-concussion syndrome). The trauma may cause a rupture in the biography of a person, also in his/her internal physiological functioning as in his/her social activities (impacts of instinctive functions and behaviours, personality changes, and adjustment difficulties on professional and personal life).

The Spanish PDSS showed acceptable internal consistency (α = .74), excellent test-retest (total score and items 1-6: α > .58, p .90) and medium to large convergent validity (r = .68, 95% CI [.54, .79], p < .01; r = .80, 95% CI [.70, .87], p < .01; r = .48, 95% CI [.28, .67], p < .01; BAI, PAS and ASI-3 total scores respectively). Data on divergent validity (BDI-II total score: r = .52, 95% CI [.34, .67], p < .01) suggest some need for refinement of the PDSS. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested a two-factor modified model for the scale (nested χ2 = 14.01, df = 12, p < .001). The Spanish PDSS has similar psychometric properties as the previous versions and is a useful instrument to assess panic symptoms in clinical settings in Spanish-speaking populations.','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00',0,0,'Fuste, Gideoni, G|Gil, María Ángeles, MÁ|López-Solà, Clara, C|Rosado, Silvia, S|Bonillo, Albert, A|Pailhez, Guillem, G|Bulbena, Antoni, A|Pérez, Víctor, V|Fullana, Miguel A, MA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(30,3,29544715,'2212-0289','[The Jena Anxiety Monitoring List (JAMoL) - a tool for the evidence-based treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care].','Behavior therapy-oriented methods are recommended for treating anxiety disorders in primary care. The treatment of patients with long-term conditions can be improved by case management and structured clinical monitoring. The present paper describes the rationale, design and application of the \'Jena Anxiety Monitoring List\' (JAMoL), a monitoring tool for the treatment of patients with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in primary care.JAMoL\'s design was based on established clinical measures, the rationale of exposure-based anxiety treatment, and research on family practice-based case management. After piloting, the JAMoL was used in the clinical study \'Jena-PARADISE\' (ISRCTN64669297), where non-physician practice staff monitored patients with panic disorder by telephone. Using semi-structured interviews in concomitant studies, study participants were asked about the instrument\'s functionality.The JAMoL assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms (6 items) as well as the patient\'s adherence to therapy (4 items) and fosters the case management-related information exchange (3 items). An integrated traffic light scheme facilitates the evaluation of monitoring results. Within the clinical study, non-physician practice staff carried out a total of 1,525 JAMoL-supported monitoring calls on 177 patients from 30 primary care practices (median calls per patient: 10 [interquartile range, 9-10]). Qualitative analyses revealed that most practice teams and patients rated the JAMoL as a practicable and treatment-relevant tool.The JAMoL enables primary care practice teams to continuously monitor anxiety symptoms and treatment adherence in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Within the behavior therapy-oriented treatment program \'Jena-PARADISE\', the JAMoL constitutes an important case management tool.','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-13 00:00:00','2018-04-30 00:00:00',0,0,'Hiller, Thomas Stephan, TS|Freytag, Antje, A|Breitbart, Jörg, J|Teismann, Tobias, T|Schöne, Elisabeth, E|Blank, Wolfgang, W|Schelle, Mercedes, M|Vollmar, Horst Christian, HC|Margraf, Jürgen, J|Gensichen, Jochen, J|für die Jena-PARADISE Study Group','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(31,4,29753156,'1523-6536','Antiviral T-Cells for Adenovirus in the Pre-Transplant Period: a Bridge Therapy for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.','Viral infections can be life-threatening in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other forms of profound primary immunodeficiency disorders both before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Here we describe the use of VSTs in an infant with RAG1 SCID who had developed disseminated adenovirus which failed to improve on cidofovir. Adenovirus cleared following two doses of VSTs and marrow infusion from a matched unrelated donor, without incidence of graft versus host disease. T cell receptor-b sequencing demonstrated expansion of adenovirus-specific T-cell fraction of the VSTs, suggesting that infusion facilitated viral clearance.

Mokken Scaling analyses were used to examine item structure and consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify predictors of the amount (number of asthma care activities HCPs delivered) and consistency (the degree to which HCPs deliver similar care) of asthma medical care and self-management support.On average, HCPs reported delivering 74,2% of guideline-recommended care. Consistency of medical care and self-management support was lower among HCPs delivering a lower amount of care (r=.58 and r=.57, p<.001). UK HCPs provided more and more consistent asthma self-management support -but not medical care- than French HCPs, which was explained by the presence of practice nurses in the UK. More training, positive social norms, and higher behavioural control explained better quality of care across all HCPs.Using carefully-developed questionnaires and advanced psychometric analyses, this study suggests that involving practice nurses, making social expectations visible, and providing more training to enhance skills and confidence in asthma care delivery could enhance the amount and consistency of asthma primary care.

Abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin antagonistically regulate many developmental processes and environmental stress responses in plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the antagonism remains poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrated that Sucrose nonfermenting1-related kinases SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6, the key kinases of ABA signaling pathway, directly interacted with and phosphorylated type-A response regulator 5 (ARR5), a negative regulator in cytokinin signaling. The phosphorylation of ARR5 at Ser residues by SnRK2s enhanced ARR5 protein stability. Accordingly, overexpression of ARR5 showed ABA hypersensitivity and drought tolerance, which could not be recapitulated by mimic non-phosphorylated ARR5. Moreover, type-B ARR1, 11, and 12 physically interacted with SnRK2s and repressed the kinase activity of SnRK2.6. The arr1,11,12 triple mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA. Genetic analysis demonstrated that SnRK2s act upstream of ARR5 and downstream of ARR1,11,12 in mediating ABA response and drought tolerance. Together, this study unravels the antagonistic action underlying ABA and cytokinin signaling pathways, thus providing insights into how plants coordinate growth and stress response by integrating multiple hormone pathways under drought stress.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Huang, Xiaozhen, X|Hou, Lingyan, L|Meng, Jingjing, J|You, Huiwen, H|Li, Zhen, Z|Gong, Zhizhong, Z|Yang, Shuhua, S|Shi, Yiting, Y','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(39,4,29752758,'1365-2222','Src-type tyrosine kinase p56lck is critical for thymic stromal lymphopoietin-induced allergic rhinitis.','Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a regulator of mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory reactions, but the manner in which TSLP contributes to allergic rhinitis (AR) remains unclear.Here we sought to determine that TSLP plays a crucial role in AR by interacting with Src-type tyrosine kinase p56lck and STAT6 and promoting mast cells degranulation.The effects of TSLP on mast cell degranulation and AR were analyzed in human mast cell line (HMC-1 cells), ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR animal model, and human subjects. Small interfering RNA experiments were performed in HMC-1 cells and OVA-induced AR model. Immune responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and histological studies.TSLP levels and mast cell-derived p56lck activation were elevated in human subjects with AR, and in AR mice, exogenous TSLP accelerated TH2-allergic inflammatory reactions by up-regulating p56lck and STAT6. On the other hand, depletion of TSLP, p56lck, and STAT6 ameliorated clinical symptoms in AR mice. The selective inhibitor of p56lck, damnacanthal inhibits AR reactions.Collectively, these observations suggest a role for TSLP/p56lck/STAT6 in AR and offer insight of potential therapeutic strategies.

Clinical studies directly comparing SCIT and SLIT report a different kinetics and magnitude of immunological changes induced during treatment. Comparative studies into the mechanisms underlying immune suppression in SCIT and SLIT are lacking.We aimed to establish an experimental model for grass pollen (GP) SCIT and SLIT that would allow a head-to-head comparison of the two treatments.Balb/c mice were sensitized with GP-extract, followed by SCIT and SLIT treatments with various GP dosages. Subsequently, we challenged mice with GP and measured airway responsiveness (AHR), GP-specific immunoglobulins, ear-swelling tests (EST), eosinophilic inflammation in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and T-cell cytokine release after re-stimulation of lung cells (IL-5, -10, and -13).We find that SLIT treatment was able to suppress allergen-induced AHR, while allergic inflammation was not effectively suppressed even at the highest GP dose in this model. In contrast, SCIT treatment induced higher levels of GP-specific IgG1, while SLIT was superior in inducing a GP-specific IgG2a response, which was associated with increased Th1 activity in lung tissue after SLIT, but not SCIT treatment. Interestingly, SCIT was able to suppress Th2-type cytokine production in lung cell suspensions, while SLIT failed to do so.In conclusion, GP-SCIT suppresses Th2 inflammation and induced neutralizing antibodies, while GP-SLIT suppresses the clinically relevant lung function parameters in an asthma mouse model, indicating that the two application routes depend on partially divergent mechanisms of tolerance induction. Interestingly, these data mirror observations in clinical studies, underscoring the translational value of these mouse models. This article is protected by copyright.

Adolescents (≥16 years) and adults having a DSD condition were included from 02/2014 to 09/2015. The main outcome QOL was measured by the WHOQOL-BREF (domains of physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment). QOL was compared to country specific reference populations by using unpaired t-tests. Linear regression models explained the additional variance of the diagnosis on QOL.Three hundred one individuals with Turner Syndrome, 219 with Klinefelter Syndrome (including XYY), 226 with 46,XX CAH and 294 with rare DSD conditions (gonadal dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome, severe hypospadias, and androgen synthesis errors or other diagnosis) took part. Compared to healthy European populations, QOL was similar in psychological, slightly worse in physical health, and slightly better in environment. In social relationships, QOL was significantly poorer compared to healthy and non-healthy reference populations. In linear regression models health status was the most important predictor of QOL; additional variance was explained by feelings about household\'s income in all domains, and the relationship status in social relationships. Diagnosis explained nearly no additional variance.Except for social relationships, most people with DSD adapt well to their life circumstances and report a good QOL.

Consistent with this, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments for cycloheximide-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed a relatively large amount of aberrant mRNA produced by the newly created splice acceptor site and a relatively small amount of wildtype mRNA produced by the normal splice acceptor site. Furthermore, most of the aberrant mRNA was shown to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and, if a small amount of aberrant mRNA may have escaped NMD, such mRNA was predicted to generate a truncated AR protein missing some functional domains. These findings imply that the deep intronic mutation creating an alternative splice acceptor site resulted in the production of a relatively small amount of wildtype AR mRNA, leading to PAIS.','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-14 00:00:00',0,0,'Ono, Hiroyuki, H|Saitsu, Hirotomo, H|Horikawa, Reiko, R|Nakashima, Shinichi, S|Ohkubo, Yumiko, Y|Yanagi, Kumiko, K|Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko, K|Fukami, Maki, M|Fujisawa, Yasuko, Y|Ogata, Tsutomu, T','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(45,5,29393262,'1661-5433','Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome at Prepuberty: Marked Loss of Spermatogonial Cells at Early Childhood and Presence of Gonocytes up to Puberty.','Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a hereditary condition in patients with a 46,XY karyotype in which loss-of-function mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene are responsible for defects in virilization. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of the lack of AR activity on germ cell survival and the degree of testicular development reached by these patients by analyzing gonadal tissue from patients with AIS prior to Sertoli cell maturation at puberty. Twenty-three gonads from 13 patients with AIS were assessed and compared to 18 testes from 17 subjects without endocrine disorders. The study of the gonadal structure using conventional microscopy and the ultrastructural characteristics of remnant germ cells using electron microscopy, combined with the immunohistochemical analysis of specific germ cell markers (MAGE-A4 for premeiotic germ cells and of OCT3/4 for gonocytes), enabled us to carry out a thorough investigation of germ cell life in an androgen-insensitive microenvironment throughout prepuberty until young adulthood. Here, we show that germ cell degeneration starts very early, with a marked decrease in number after only 2 years of life, and we demonstrate the permanence of gonocytes in AIS testis samples until puberty, describing 2 different populations. Additionally, our results provide further evidence for the importance of AR signaling in peritubular myoid cells during prepuberty to maintain Sertoli and spermatogonial cell health and survival.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-01-24 00:00:00','2018-02-27 00:00:00',0,0,'Aliberti, Paula, P|Perez Garrido, Natalia, N|Marino, Roxana, R|Ramirez, Pablo, P|Solari, Alberto J, AJ|Sciurano, Roberta, R|Costanzo, Mariana, M|Guercio, Gabriela, G|Warman, Diana Mónica, DM|Bailez, Marcela, M|Baquedano, María Sonia, MS|Rivarola, Marco A, MA|Belgorosky, Alicia, A|Berensztein, Esperanza, E','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(46,5,29388223,'1365-2230','Aberrant breast tissue in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.','No abstract found.','2018-06-01 00:00:00','2018-02-01 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Nazzaro, G, G|Genovese, G, G|Brena, M, M|Passoni, E, E|Tadini, G, G','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(47,5,29386228,'2049-3614','Disorders of sex development: a study of 194 cases.','To study the clinical proﬁle and the management of patients with disorders of sex development (DSD).Retrospective study from a tertiary care hospital of North India.One hundred ninety-four patients of DSD registered in the Endocrine clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh between 1995 and 2014 were included.One hundred and two patients (52.5%) had 46,XY DSD and seventy-four patients (38.1%) had 46,XX DSD.

We used The Health Improvement Network database (comprising the years 2000-2012) to identify incident patients with epilepsy. The index date was that on which they met the case definition for epilepsy, and analyses only included patients who remained on monotherapy or received no AED therapy following diagnosis to avoid confounding by polytherapy. Psychiatric symptoms were defined using mental health clinical or treatment (medical or therapeutic) code. We analyzed the AED of interest as a time-varying covariate in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models controlling for confounding factors. We identified 9595 patients with incident epilepsy, 7400 of whom (77%) received a first-recorded AED prescription. Prescriptions for newer generation AEDs (lamotrigine and levetiracetam) steadily increased (constituting over 30% of all AED prescriptions by 2012) while valproate use significantly declined in females (~40% in 2002 to just over 20% by 2012). A total of 2190 patients were first exposed to carbamazepine (29.3%) and 222 to lamotrigine (3%), both of which were associated with a lower hazard of any coded psychiatric symptom or disorder in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.73-0.97; p = 0.02 and HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.99; p = 0.03, respectively, for carbamazepine and lamotrigine).

We evaluated 746 veterans using the CAPS to assess PTSD and the PHQ-9 to measure depression and suicidal ideation.

In multivariate logistic regression models, this association remained significant after controlling for demographics and symptom severity. Anger, hostility, anxiety, alcohol use, optimism and social support did not explain the elevated risk of suicidal ideation in the comorbid group in fully adjusted models. As suicidal ideation is a known risk factor for suicide attempts and completions, veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression represent a vulnerable group who may need more intensive monitoring and treatment to reduce risk of suicide.','2018-04-22 00:00:00','2018-04-22 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Arenson, Melanie B, MB|Whooley, Mary A, MA|Neylan, Thomas C, TC|Maguen, Shira, S|Metzler, Thomas J, TJ|Cohen, Beth E, BE','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(53,6,29753050,'1878-4216','Sex-specific differences in corticosterone secretion, behavioral phenotypes and expression of TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL receptor isoforms: Impact of systemic TrkB inhibition and combinatory stress exposure in adolescence.','Stress exposure has been implicated in the development of mood disorders, although little is known about the lasting effects of repeated stress during the adolescent period on sex-specific differences in endocrine and plasticity-signaling responses in adulthood. Using a 10-day combinatory stress paradigm (postnatal day (PND) 26 to 35), we examined sex-specific impact of adolescent stress and inhibition of tyrosine-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor (ANA-12; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) on 1) adolescent blood corticosterone levels, 2) adult locomotion and anxiety behavior, and 3) region-specific differences in endogenous TrkB full-length (TrkB.FL) and truncated (TrkB.T1) receptor isoforms. Blood collected on days 1, 5 and 10 revealed elevated basal and stress-induced CORT secretion in females compared to males, while ANA-12 attenuated CORT elevations post stress in both sexes. As adults, all females exhibit higher locomotor and exploratory activity than males in the open field test and elevated plus maze, and differences were comparable in the forced swim within stress-naïve and stress groups. Biochemically, vehicle-treated males showed elevated TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL compared to vehicle-treated females in the PFC, hippocampus and NAc, and levels were consistently attenuated by ANA-12 treatment in non-stress males. With regards to stress exposure, expression of both isoforms was strongly down-regulated in the NAc of males only and was associated with increased TrkB.T1 in the PFC. ANA-12 enhanced expression in females, independent of stress exposure, compared to vehicle-treated counterparts, expression being increased for TrkB.T1 versus TrkB.FL and magnitude of the changes being region-specific. In contrast, ANA-12 effects in stressed males were restricted to inhibition of both isoforms in the hippocampus. Together, our findings support that TrkB activation, contingent on stress exposure, differentially affects TrkB isoform regulation during adulthood. Sex-specific biochemical responses at delayed intervals following adolescent stress exposure further support the need to include the sex variable in animal models.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Azogu, Idu, I|Liang, Jacky, J|Plamondon, Helene, H','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(54,6,29752662,'1573-3327','Executive Attention and Empathy-Related Responses in Boys with Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder, With and Without Comorbid Anxiety Disorder.','This is a first study that investigated the relationships between executive attention-as an important aspect of emotion regulation-and state empathy and sympathy in ODD/CD boys with (N = 31) and without (N = 18) comorbid anxiety disorder (7-12 years).

Two hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme\'s impact on the participants\' lives, diet and health.

These results suggest that TCI-R could offer a valuable dimensional method for predicting the risk of anxiety disorders in diverse depressed patients.','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Paavonen, Vesa, V|Luoto, Kaisa, K|Lassila, Antero, A|Leinonen, Esa, E|Kampman, Olli, O','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(59,6,29751238,'1573-2517','Prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among youth with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.','The purpose of this meta-analytic study was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of anxiety and depressive disorders among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) and to assess the extent to which these pooled prevalence rates differed according to studies\' characteristics.A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases and 21 studies, published between 1975 and 2015, met the inclusion criteria.The resulting pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety and depressive disorders were respectively (a) 5.4% and 2.8% across samples; (b) 1.2% and 0.03% among children; and (c) 7.9% and 1.4% among adolescents.

The HD group reported more impairment than did the HC group in domains of memory, distractibility, blunders, memory for names, and inattention. These differences generally remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. In the HD group, the degree of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with severity of saving and acquiring behaviors, although results were attenuated when controlling for comorbid symptoms (overall HD severity, but not saving behavior specifically, remained significantly correlated with cognitive impairment). Subjective cognitive impairment was further associated with a desire to save possessions in order to avoid forgetting, and these results remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms.

The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and incidence of PADs in patients suffering from parietal lobe gliomas through a prospective study and a battery of comprehensive neuropsychological tests. METHODS Between 2012 and 2016 the authors recruited 38 patients with glioma confined in the parietal lobe. Patients were examined for primary and secondary association deficits with a dedicated battery of neuropsychological tests. The PADs were grouped into 5 categories: visuospatial attention, gnosis, praxis, upper-limb coordination, and language. For descriptive analysis tumors were divided into high- and low-grade gliomas and also according to patient age and tumor size. RESULTS Parietal association deficits were elicited in 80% of patients, thus being more common than primary deficits (50%). Apraxia was the most common PAD (47.4%), followed by anomic aphasia and subcomponents of Gerstmann\'s syndrome (34.2% each). Other deficits such as hemineglect, stereoagnosia, extinction, and visuomotor ataxia were also detected, albeit at lower rates. There was a statistically nonsignificant difference between PADs and sex (72.2% males, 85% females) and age (77.8% at ≤ 60 years, 80% at age > 60 years), but a statistically significant difference between the > 4 cm and the ≤ 4 cm diameter group (p = 0.02, 94.7% vs 63.2%, respectively). There was a tendency (p = 0.094) for low-grade gliomas to present with fewer PADs (50%) than high-grade gliomas (85.7%). Tumor laterality showed a strong correlation with hemineglect (p = 0.004, predilection for right hemisphere), anomia (p = 0.001), and Gerstmann\'s symptoms (p = 0.01); the last 2 deficits showed a left (dominant) hemispheric preponderance. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to prospectively evaluate the incidence and nature of PADs in patients with parietal gliomas. It could be that the current literature may have underestimated the true incidence of deficits. Dedicated neuropsychological examination detects a high frequency of PADs, the most common being apraxia, followed by anomia and subcomponents of Gerstmann\'s syndrome. Nevertheless, a direct correlation between the clinical deficit and its anatomical substrate is only possible to a limited extent, highlighting the need for intraoperative cortical and subcortical functional mapping.','2018-05-04 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00',0,0,'Liouta, Evangelia, E|Stranjalis, George, G|Kalyvas, Aristotelis V, AV|Koutsarnakis, Christos, C|Pantinaki, Stavroula, S|Liakos, Faidon, F|Komaitis, Spyros, S|Stavrinou, Lampis C, LC','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(62,7,29722099,'1097-0193','Deficient supplementary motor area at rest: Neural basis of limb kinetic deficits in Parkinson\'s disease.','Parkinson\'s disease (PD) patients frequently suffer from limb kinetic apraxia (LKA) affecting quality of life. LKA denotes an impairment of precise and independent finger movements beyond bradykinesia, which is reliably assessed by coin rotation (CR) task. BOLD fMRI detected activation of a left inferior parietal-premotor praxis network in PD during CR. Here, we explored which network site is most critical for LKA using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Based on a hierarchical model, we hypothesized that LKA would predominantly affect the functional integrity of premotor areas including supplementary motor areas (SMA). Furthermore, we suspected that for praxis function with higher demand on temporal-spatial processing such as gesturing, inferior parietal lobule (IPL) upstream to premotor areas would be essential. A total of 21 PD patients and 20 healthy controls underwent ASL acquisition during rest. Behavioral assessment outside the scanner involved the CR, finger tapping task, and the test of upper limb apraxia (TULIA). Whole-brain analysis of activity at rest showed a significant reduction of CR-related perfusion in the left SMA of PD. Furthermore, the positive correlation between SMA perfusion and CR, seen in controls, was lost in patients. By contrast, TULIA was significantly associated with the perfusion of left IPL in both patients and controls. In conclusion, the findings suggest that LKA in PD are linked to an intrinsic disruption of the left SMA function, which may only be overcome by compensatory network activation. In addition, gestural performance relies on IPL which remains available for functional recruitment in early PD.','2018-05-02 00:00:00','2018-05-02 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00',0,0,'Kübel, Stefanie, S|Stegmayer, Katharina, K|Vanbellingen, Tim, T|Walther, Sebastian, S|Bohlhalter, Stephan, S','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(63,7,29713440,'2040-2295','Social Robotics in Therapy of Apraxia of Speech.','Apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder in which messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted, resulting in an inability for moving lips or tongue to the right place to pronounce sounds correctly.

In contrast, the function and value knowledge tasks resulted in a significant strengthening of the effective connectivity between visual cortex and fusiform gyrus. Importantly, this modulation was present in both semantic tasks, indicating that processing different aspects of semantic knowledge about tools evokes similar effective connectivity patterns. Data revealed that interregional effective connectivity during the processing of tool knowledge occurred in a bidirectional manner with a weakening of connectivity between areas engaged in action and semantic knowledge about tools during the processing of action knowledge.

Mokken Scaling analyses were used to examine item structure and consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify predictors of the amount (number of asthma care activities HCPs delivered) and consistency (the degree to which HCPs deliver similar care) of asthma medical care and self-management support.On average, HCPs reported delivering 74,2% of guideline-recommended care. Consistency of medical care and self-management support was lower among HCPs delivering a lower amount of care (r=.58 and r=.57, p<.001). UK HCPs provided more and more consistent asthma self-management support -but not medical care- than French HCPs, which was explained by the presence of practice nurses in the UK.

Clinical studies directly comparing SCIT and SLIT report a different kinetics and magnitude of immunological changes induced during treatment. Comparative studies into the mechanisms underlying immune suppression in SCIT and SLIT are lacking.We aimed to establish an experimental model for grass pollen (GP) SCIT and SLIT that would allow a head-to-head comparison of the two treatments.Balb/c mice were sensitized with GP-extract, followed by SCIT and SLIT treatments with various GP dosages. Subsequently, we challenged mice with GP and measured airway responsiveness (AHR), GP-specific immunoglobulins, ear-swelling tests (EST), eosinophilic inflammation in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and T-cell cytokine release after re-stimulation of lung cells (IL-5, -10, and -13).We find that SLIT treatment was able to suppress allergen-induced AHR, while allergic inflammation was not effectively suppressed even at the highest GP dose in this model. In contrast, SCIT treatment induced higher levels of GP-specific IgG1, while SLIT was superior in inducing a GP-specific IgG2a response, which was associated with increased Th1 activity in lung tissue after SLIT, but not SCIT treatment. Interestingly, SCIT was able to suppress Th2-type cytokine production in lung cell suspensions, while SLIT failed to do so.In conclusion, GP-SCIT suppresses Th2 inflammation and induced neutralizing antibodies, while GP-SLIT suppresses the clinically relevant lung function parameters in an asthma mouse model, indicating that the two application routes depend on partially divergent mechanisms of tolerance induction. Interestingly, these data mirror observations in clinical studies, underscoring the translational value of these mouse models. This article is protected by copyright.

The study was based on the survey data retrospectively retrieved from the Action Health-Lung Cancer Prophylaxis and Health Care Improvement screening program that concerned all the inhabitants, aged over 40, of the Proszowice administrative region situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland. Participants with the symptoms suggestive of a lung disease were subject to further evaluation. The findings were that 546 (13.3%) out of the 4105 individuals displayed spirometry features of COPD. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 92 (16.8%) out of the COPD afflicted persons. Chronic bronchitis was commoner in current smokers and its incidence increased with increasing severity of airway obstruction. In multivariate analysis, chronic bronchitis was independently related to lower FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and to dyspnea. In regression model, factors related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis were current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function. We conclude that COPD with coexisting chronic bronchitis is linked to severer dyspnea and worse lung function. Current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function are related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis accompanying COPD.','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Mejza, Filip, F|Nastałek, Paweł, P|Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka, A|Doniec, Zbigniew, Z|Skucha, Wojciech, W','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(74,8,29752613,'1672-0415','Immune Homeostasis: Effects of Chinese Herbal Formulae and Herb-Derived Compounds on Allergic Asthma in Different Experimental Models.','Allergic asthma is thought to arise from an imbalance of immune regulation, which is characterized by the production of large quantities of IgE antibodies by B cells and a decrease of the interferon-γ/interleukin-4 (Th1/Th2) ratio. Certain immunomodulatory components and Chinese herbal formulae have been used in traditional herbal medicine for thousands of years. However, there are few studies performing evidence-based Chinese medicine (CM) research on the mechanisms and effificacy of these drugs in allergic asthma. This review aims to explore the roles of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived compounds in experimental research models of allergic asthma. We screened published modern CM research results on the experimental effects of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds for allergic asthma and their possible underlying mechanisms in English language articles from the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases with the keywords allergic asthma, experimental model and Chinese herbal medicine. We found 22 Chinese herb species and 31 herb-derived anti-asthmatic compounds as well as 12 Chinese herbal formulae which showed a reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergen-specifific immunoglobulin E, inflflammatory cell infifiltration and a regulation of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Chinese herbal formulae and herbderived bioactive compounds exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflflammatory and anti-asthma activities in different experimental models and their various mechanisms of action are being investigated in modern CM research with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics technologies, which will lead to a new era in the development of new drug discovery for allergic asthma in CM.','2018-05-01 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Liu, Lu, L|Wang, Lin-Peng, LP|He, Shan, S|Ma, Yan, Y','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(75,8,29752346,'1468-3296','Rates of asthma exacerbations and mortality and associated factors in Uganda: a 2-year prospective cohort study.','Data on asthma treatment outcomes in Africa are limited. 449 patients with asthma (age 5-93 years) in Uganda were followed up for 2 years to determine rates of exacerbations and mortality and associated factors.

Considering only the first year of follow-up, 59.6% of the patients experienced at least one exacerbation, 32.4% experienced three or more exacerbations. A multivariable model showed that the likelihood of experiencing at least one exacerbation in the first year of follow-up was lower with better baseline asthma control (higher asthma control test (ACT) score), with OR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.93, P=0.000), and was higher with more exacerbations in the year prior to enrolment (OR for log number of exacerbations 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.57, P=0.018).

Information on asthma prevalence in the Middle East is fragmented and relatively out-dated. The SNAPSHOT program was conducted to obtain updated information.SNAPSHOT is a cross-sectional epidemiological program carried out in five Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, the latter three grouped into a Gulf cluster) to collect data on asthma, allergic rhinitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and bipolar disorder. The survey was carried out by telephone in a random sample of the adult general population with quotas defined according to country demographics. The analysis presented in this paper focuses on asthma. Subjects were screened for asthma based on criteria from the global Asthma Insights and Reality studies. Current prevalence (last 12 months) was estimated. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors related to asthma and the association with allergic rhinitis and other co-morbidities. Quality of life was assessed using the three-level EQ-5D questionnaire.2124 out of the 33,486 subjects enrolled in the SNAPSHOT program fulfilled the criteria for asthma. The adjusted prevalence of asthma ranged from 4.4% [95% CI: 4.0-4.8%] in Turkey, to 6.7% [95% CI: 6.2-7.2%] in Egypt and 7.6% [95% CI: 7.1-8.0%] in the Gulf cluster. Prevalence was higher (p < 0.0001) in women than men and increased with age (p < 0.0001). Co-morbidities occurred more frequently in asthma subjects compared to the non-asthma population (38% vs. 15% p < 0.0001).

Immunization with aluminum adjuvants, as with helminth infection, induces a Th2 type cell mediated immune response, including eosinophilia, but does not induce an environment conducive to the induction of regulatory mechanisms. Helminths play a role in what is known as the hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that decreased exposure to microbes during a critical time in early life has resulted in the increased prevalence and morbidity of asthma and atopic disorders over the past few decades, especially in Western countries. In addition, gut and lung microbiome composition and their interaction with the immune system plays an important role in a properly regulated immune system. Disturbances in microbiome composition are a risk factor for asthma and allergies. We propose that immunization with aluminum adjuvants in general is not favorable for induction of regulatory mechanisms and, in the context of the hygiene hypothesis and microbiome theory, can be viewed as an amplifying factor and significant contributing risk factor for allergic diseases, especially in a genetically susceptible subpopulation.','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Terhune, Todd D, TD|Deth, Richard C, RC','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(79,8,29750604,'1741-0541','Pharmacogenomic test that predicts response to β-agonists in adults with asthma is cost effective.','Pharmacogenomic tests that predict which asthma patients are likely to respond to β-agonists hold promise to improve care for asthma.To identify the clinical and economic circumstances under which a pharmacogenomic test that predicts response to β-agonists might or might not be an appropriate, cost-effective option.We synthesized published data on clinical and economic outcomes in adults 18-35 to project 10-year costs, quality-adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response.Pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response conferred a cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with no testing.Pharmacogenomic testing for β-agonist response in individuals with asthma is potentially cost effective and should be pursued by test developers.','2015-11-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Wu, Ann Chen, AC|Gay, Charlene, C|Rett, Melisa D, MD|Fuhlbrigge, Anne L, AL','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(80,8,29749828,'1741-0541','Candidate gene analysis of asthma in a population of Arab descent: a case-control study in Jordan.','To evaluate whether SNPs (n = 15) in ten candidate genes (ADRB2, ADH5, ARGI, CRHR1, STIP1, LTA4H, LTC4S, ALOX5, ABCC1 and OATP2B1) are associated with asthma in Jordanian population of Arab descent.A case-control study included 245 adult asthmatics and 249 controls.Significant genetic association was identified at the rs2236647 (T/C) SNP in STIP1 and risk of asthma (p < 0.001).

Here we present a co-formulation of an antitoxin to the three most important serotypes. Combining these antibodies obviates the need to identify the serotype causing intoxication prior to drug administration, which would facilitate administration. The lyophilized powder formulation contains nine mAbs, three mAbs for each of the three serotypes (A, B, E).

No significant increase in soluble higher order aggregates, cleavage products, or change in charge isoforms was measured after storage as a lyophilized powder at 50°C for one year. Furthermore, toxin-domain binding ELISA data indicated that each of the individual antibodies in the lyophilized drug product showed essentially full binding capability to their respective toxin domains after being stored at 50°C for one year.

This paper reviews published literature about microbial hazards, plant toxins, and chemical hazards. Microbial hazards include Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, and various mold species. High concentrations of C. botulinum in silage have been associated with cattle botulism. A high initial concentration of C. botulinum spores in forage in combination with poor silage fermentation conditions can promote the growth of C. botulinum in silage. The elevated pH level that is generally associated with aerobic deterioration of silage is a major factor influencing concentrations of L. monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and molds in silage and may also encourage survival and growth of M. bovis, the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis. Soil is a major source of B. cereus spores in silage; growth of this bacterium in silage appears to be limited. Hazards from plant toxins include pyrrolizidine, tropane and tropolone alkaloids, phytoestrogens, prussic acid, and mimosine, compounds that exist naturally in certain plant species that may contaminate forages at harvesting. Another group of toxins belonging to this category are ergot alkaloids, which are produced by endophytic fungal species in forages such as tall fescue grass, sorghum, and ryegrass. Varying effects of ensiling on the degradation of these plant toxins have been reported. Chemical hazards include nitrate, nitrite, and toxic oxide gases of nitrogen produced from nitrate and high levels of butyric acid, biogenic amines, and ammonia. Chemical and microbiological hazards are associated with poorly fermented silages, which can be avoided by using proper silage-making practices and creating conditions that promote a rapid and sufficient reduction of the silage pH and prevent aerobic deterioration.','2018-05-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-04-24 00:00:00',0,0,'Driehuis, F, F|Wilkinson, J M, JM|Jiang, Y, Y|Ogunade, I, I|Adesogan, A T, AT','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(87,9,29678457,'1095-8274','Erratum to \"Investigation of Clostridium botulinum group III\'s mobilome content\" [Anaerobe 49 (2018) 71-77].','No abstract found.','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-04-18 00:00:00','2018-04-21 00:00:00',0,0,'Woudstra, Cédric, C|Le Maréchal, Caroline, C|Souillard, Rozenn, R|Anniballi, Fabrizio, F|Auricchio, Bruna, B|Bano, Luca, L|Bayon-Auboyer, Marie-Hélène, MH|Koene, Miriam, M|Mermoud, Isabelle, I|Brito, Roseane B, RB|Lobato, Francisco C F, FCF|Silva, Rodrigo O S, ROS|Dorner, Martin B, MB|Fach, Patrick, P','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(88,9,29677267,'1539-3704','The Short-Lived Epidemic of Botulism From Commercially Canned Foods in the United States, 1919 to 1925.','In 1919, three deadly outbreaks of botulism caused by consumption of canned olives packed in California captured national headlines. In all of the outbreaks, which occurred in separate locales, unsuspecting people died after consuming tainted food during a banquet or family meal. The press\'s sensational portrayal of canned food as hazardous aroused alarm among consumers at a time when commercial canning was becoming more common. Intent on restoring the image of their product as safe and wholesome, canning industry leaders funded a \"botulism commission\" of scientific experts in 1919 to investigate how to systematically eliminate the threat of botulism that had imperiled their business. The commissioners identified the scientific reasons for the outbreaks, and on the basis of their findings, the California Department of Public Health issued explicit recommendations for sterilization procedures intended to ensure safety. However, the department did not mandate inspections for all canneries. When commercially packed fruits and vegetables continued to cause botulism, industry leaders voluntarily backed a cannery inspection act to legally require all California canners to possess appropriate equipment and follow scientifically validated sterilization procedures. After the California legislature approved the act in 1925, canneries were inspected, regulations were enforced, and no further outbreaks occurred. This botulism epidemic is an example of a disease outbreak that was controlled when business interests became aligned with public health goals. The press\'s portrayal of afflicted persons as innocent victims and worthy citizens galvanized businessmen to implement safeguards to protect consumers from botulism intoxication.

Herein, using Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antagonist)-responsive genes along with transcriptomics of synovial tissue from multiple stages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease progression, we have interrogated the activity status of PD-1 pathway during RA development. We demonstrate that the expression of PD-1 was increased in early and established RA synovial tissue compared to normal and OA synovium, whereas that of its ligands, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, was increased at all the stages of RA disease progression, namely arthralgia, IA/undifferentiated arthritis, early RA and established RA. Further, we show that RA patients expressed PD-1 on a majority of synovial tissue infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, enrichment of Nivolumab gene signature was observed in IA and RA, indicating that the PD-1 pathway was downregulated during RA disease progression. Furthermore, serum soluble (s) PD-1 levels were increased in autoantibody positive early RA patients. Interestingly, most of the early RA synovium tissue sections showed negative PD-L1 staining by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, downregulation in PD-1 inhibitory signaling in RA could be attributed to increased serum sPD-1 and decreased synovial tissue PD-L1 levels.

ASPA encodes aspartoacylase, an oligodendroglial enzyme that cleaves the abundant brain amino acid N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) to L-aspartate and acetate. Aspartoacylase deficiency results in a 50% or greater elevation in brain NAA concentration ([NAA]). Prior studies showed that homozygous constitutive knockout of Nat8l, the gene encoding the neuronal NAA synthesizing enzyme N-acetyltransferase 8-like, prevents aspartoacylase-deficient mice from developing spongiform leukodystrophy.

In the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), a diverse spectrum of targeted biochemical assays is employed to analyze a limited amount of metabolites. We now present a single-platform, high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) method that can be applied for holistic metabolic profiling in plasma of individual IEM-suspected patients. This method, which we termed \"next-generation metabolic screening\" (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample. In the NGMS workflow, features identified in patient and control samples are aligned using the \"various forms of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS)\" software package. Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted setting, which we term \"open the metabolome\" analysis. This approach identifies potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory diagnostics of IEMs.','2018-02-16 00:00:00','2018-02-16 00:00:00','2018-02-17 00:00:00',0,0,'Coene, Karlien L M, KLM|Kluijtmans, Leo A J, LAJ|van der Heeft, Ed, E|Engelke, Udo F H, UFH|de Boer, Siebolt, S|Hoegen, Brechtje, B|Kwast, Hanneke J T, HJT|van de Vorst, Maartje, M|Huigen, Marleen C D G, MCDG|Keularts, Irene M L W, IMLW|Schreuder, Michiel F, MF|van Karnebeek, Clara D M, CDM|Wortmann, Saskia B, SB|de Vries, Maaike C, MC|Janssen, Mirian C H, MCH|Gilissen, Christian, C|Engel, Jasper, J|Wevers, Ron A, RA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(93,10,29401083,'1536-4801','Molecular Comparison of Adult and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Indicates Broad Similarity of Molecular Pathways in Disease Tissue.','Efficacy data from adult ulcerative colitis (UC) clinical trials are often extrapolated for pediatric prescribing.

Toxic NAA accumulation appears to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan disease-a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading enzyme aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for this spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target tissue and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan disease, abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the spectrum, while predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased brain NAA levels are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice overexpressing the NAA synthesising enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA levels were uncoupled from neurological deficits. In contrast, elimination of aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes elicited Canavan disease like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion in oligodendrocytes abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase in peripheral organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and ameliorate histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and complete aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting oligodendrocytes in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS pathology and lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first successful post-symptomatic treatment of a white matter disorder using an adeno-associated virus vector tailored towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene expression.','2018-01-01 00:00:00','2017-11-07 00:00:00','2018-01-23 00:00:00',0,0,'von Jonquieres, Georg, G|Spencer, Ziggy H T, ZHT|Rowlands, Benjamin D, BD|Klugmann, Claudia B, CB|Bongers, Andre, A|Harasta, Anne E, AE|Parley, Kristina E, KE|Cederholm, Jennie, J|Teahan, Orla, O|Pickford, Russell, R|Delerue, Fabien, F|Ittner, Lars M, LM|Fröhlich, Dominik, D|McLean, Catriona A, CA|Don, Anthony S, AS|Schneider, Miriam, M|Housley, Gary D, GD|Rae, Caroline D, CD|Klugmann, Matthias, M','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(100,11,29752948,'1095-8584','Functional and transcriptomic insights into pathogenesis of R9C phospholamban mutation using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.','Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can be caused by mutations in the cardiac protein phospholamban (PLN).

RNA-seq suggests that R9C PLN results in an altered metabolic state and profibrotic signaling, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis and picrosirius staining of R9C PLN hECTs.

We examine perilipin 5 in normal human tissues and in diseases using protein biochemical and microscopic techniques. Perilipin 5 was constitutively located at small lipid droplets in skeletal myocytes, cardiomyocytes and brown adipocytes. In addition, perilipin 5 was detected in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, especially in hepatocytes, the mitochondria-rich parietal cells of the stomach, tubular kidney cells and ductal cells of the salivary gland and pancreas. Granular cytoplasmic expression, without a lipid droplet-bound localization was detected elsewhere. In cardiomyopathies, in skeletal muscle diseases and during hepatocyte steatogenesis, perilipin 5 was upregulated and localized to larger and more numerous lipid droplets. In steatotic human hepatocytes, perilipin 5 was moderately increased and colocalized with perilipins 1 and 2 but not with perilipin 3 at lipid droplets. In liver diseases implicated in alterations of mitochondria, such as mitochondriopathies, alcoholic liver disease, Wilson\'s disease and acute liver injury, perilipin 5 was frequently localized to small lipid droplets and less in the cytoplasm. In tumorigenesis, perilipin 5 was especially upregulated in lipo-, leio- and rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma.

Echocardiography and histologic studies were performed 12 weeks after streptozocin injection. Protein levels involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting in diabetic hearts or high-glucose (HG, 30 mM)- and palmitic acid (PA, 300 μM)-cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). ROS generation and structural alterations of mitochondria were also assessed. We report that NAC alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac abnormality, including restored ejection fraction (EF %), fraction shortening (FS %), peak E to peak A ratio (E/A) and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects were concomitant with blocked ERS and apoptosis, as evidenced by inactivation of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α)/spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), phosphorylated protein kinase-like kinase (PERK)/phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)/activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6α)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathways, as well as suppressed Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 expressions. Mechanistically, PA mediated excessive mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which were antagonized by NAC and Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS inhibitor. No effects were noted by addition of apocynin, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX 4) and NOX 2 expressions were not altered, indicating that PA-induced ROS generation is independent of NADPH oxidases. Most intriguingly, HG failed to promote ROS production despite its ability to promote ERS and apoptosis in NRCMs. Collectively, these findings indicate that NAC primarily abrogates PA-mediated mitochondrial ROS through ERS and therefore alleviates myocardial apoptosis but has little effect on HG-induced cardiac injury.

After providing anaesthesia and aseptic conditions, 0.25 ml of 10% procaine was injected to the right knee joint, and 0.25 ml of normal saline (as control group) was injected to the left knee joint. Knee joint samples were obtained from four rats in each group after appropriate euthanasia on days 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21. The histological sections of the articular and periarticular regions and the synovium were evaluated by two histologists, and inflammatory changes were graded according to a five-point scale in a blinded manner.

We previously demonstrated that speed of wave propagation through a tendon in the carpal tunnel measured by ultrasound elastography could be used as an indicator of carpal tunnel pressure in a cadaveric model, in which a balloon had to be inserted into the carpal tunnel to adjust the carpal tunnel pressure. However, the method for adjusting the carpal tunnel pressure in the cadaveric model is not applicable for the in vivo model. The objective of this study was to utilize a different technique to adjust carpal tunnel pressure via pressing the palm and to validate it with ultrasound surface wave elastography in a human cadaveric model. The outcome was also compared with a previous balloon insertion technique. Results showed that wave speed of intra-carpal tunnel tendon and the ratio of wave speed of intra-and outer-carpal tunnel tendons increased linearly with carpal tunnel pressure. Moreover, wave speed of intra carpal tunnel tendon via both ways of altering carpal tunnel pressure showed similar results with high correlation. Therefore, it was concluded that the technique of pressing the palm can be used to adjust carpal tunnel pressure, and pressure changes can be detected via ultrasound surface wave elastography in an ex vivo model.

In order to rationalize perspectives on preventive strategies in oral cancer management, this paper addresses a number of fundamental questions regarding carcinogenesis: Proliferation - what epithelial cell changes precede tumour development? Position - why are certain oral sites so predisposed to cancer? Progression - why do some precursor lesions progress to invasive carcinoma and others do not?

Changes in uptake were tested for their statistical significance using multivariate logistic regression models.In all cities overall uptake of services increased. Having used all services for contraception, STI care, HIV testing, HIV care, cervical cancer screening and sexual violence, if needed, increased from 12.5% to 41.5% in Durban, 25.0% to 40.1% in Tete, and 44.9% to 69.1% in Mombasa. Across cities, the effect was greatest in having been tested for HIV in the past six months which increased from 40.9% to 83.2% in Durban, 56.0% to 76.6% in Tete, and 70.9% to 87.6% in Mombasa. In Tete and Mombasa rise in SRH service use was almost entirely due to a greater uptake of targeted services. Only in Durban was there additionally an increase in the utilization of general health services.SRH service utilization improved in the short-term in three different sub-Saharan African contexts, primarily through vertical, targeted components. The long-term effectiveness of diagonal approaches, in particular on the use of general, horizontal health services, needs further investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

Our study aims to investigate the effects of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) on tumor growth and immune function by targeting PTEN via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in tumor-bearing mice. C57BL/6 female mice were used for tumor-bearing mouse models and their tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected, and normal cervical tissues were obtained from normal mice. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were detected by ELISA. The cells were divided into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), miR-92a mimic, miR-92a inhibitor, siRNA-PTEN, and miR-92a inhibitor + siRNA-PTEN groups. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was adopted to determine the relationship between PTEN and miR-92a. Expressions of miR-92a, PTEN, TNF-α, sIL-2R, ERK1, and ERK2 were tested by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was detected by cell count kit-8 (CCK-8); cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Compared with the normal cervical tissues and adjacent normal tissues, the cervical cancer tissues exhibited increased expressions of miR-92a, p-ERK1/2, and serum levels of TNF-α and sIL-2R while decreased PTEN expression. PTEN was confirmed to be the target gene of miR-92a. As compared with the blank and NC groups, expressions of miR-92a, ERK1 and ERK2 increased, and expressions of PTEN decreased in the miR-92a mimic group. The miR-92a mimic group exhibited increased expression levels of TNF-α and sIL-2R, cell proliferation, and cell number in S phase but decreased cell apoptosis, and cell number in G0/G1 phase, while the miR-92a inhibitor group followed opposite trends. miR-92a promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune function by inhibiting PTEN via activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in mice bearing U14 cervical cancer.','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Li, Zeng-Hui, ZH|Li, Lei, L|Kang, Lin-Ping, LP|Wang, Yan, Y','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(125,13,29752277,'1078-0432','The highly metastatic nature of uterine cervical/endometrial cancer displaying tumor-related leukocytosis: clinical and preclinical investigations.','The aim of this study was to investigate the metastatic potential of uterine cervical and endometrial cancer displaying tumor-related leukocytosis (TRL).Clinical data on uterine cervical (N=732) and endometrial cancer　(N=900) were collected, and the metastatic potential of TRL-positive cancer was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Tumor and blood samples obtained from cervical cancer patients, cervical cancer cell lines, and a mouse model of cervical cancer were employed to examine the mechanisms underlying the highly metastatic nature of TRL-positive cancer, focusing on tumor-derived granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)-mediated premetastatic niche.Pretreatment TRL was significantly associated with visceral organ metastasis in patients with uterine cervical or endometrial cancer. The TRL-positive cervical cancer patients displayed upregulated tumor G-CSF expression, elevated G-CSF levels, and increased MDSC frequencies in the peripheral blood compared with the TRL-negative patients. In vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that MDSC produced in response to tumor-derived G-CSF are involved in premetastatic niche formation, which promotes visceral organ metastasis of TRL-positive cancer. The depletion of MDSC attenuated this premetastatic niche formation and effectively inhibited the visceral organ metastasis of TRL-positive cancer.Uterine cervical/endometrial cancer displaying TRL is a distinct clinical entity with high metastatic potential. Tumor-derived G-CSF and the MDSC-mediated premetastatic niche are responsible for the highly metastatic nature of this type of cancer.

This study is designed to examine the interaction of cisplatin with human alpha-2-macroglobulin through various biophysical techniques and drug binding through molecular modeling. Cisplatin alters the function of alpha-2-macroglobulin and the thiolesters are most likely the reactive sites for cisplatin. Our result suggests that cisplatin decreases the antiproteolytic potential and causes structural and functional change in human alpha-2-macroglobulin as evident by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Change in secondary structure of alpha-2-macroglobulin was confirmed by CD and FTIR. Thermodynamics parameters such as entropy (ΔS), enthalpy (ΔH) and Gibb\'s free energy changes (ΔG) along with number of binding sites (N) and affinity constant (K) of αM-cisplatin binding in solutions were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. It was found that binding of cisplatin with alpha-2-macroglobulin is exothermic in nature.

We examined alterations in the intra- and inter-network functional connectivities in 21 individuals with CRPS and 49 controls. CRPS-related reduction in intra-network functional connectivity was found in the attention network. Individuals with CRPS had greater inter-network connectivities between the attention and salience networks as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, individuals within the CRPS group with high levels of pain catastrophizing showed greater inter-network connectivities between the attention and salience networks.

Practical aspects include sympatholysis, analgesia and Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) reduction with dexmedetomidine; analgesia with low-dose ketamine and co-anaesthesia; and sympatholysis with intravenous lignocaine. Non-opioid adjuvants such as NSAIDS, paracetamol, magnesium, local anaesthetic infiltration and high-dose steroids are added in the perioperative period to further achieve co-analgesia.

Imaging assessment of traumatic shoulder pain begins with conventional radiography and, depending on physical examination findings, will require MRI or MR arthrography for assessment of soft-tissue injuries and CT for delineation of fracture planes. Ultrasound excels in assessment of rotator cuff injuries but has limited usefulness for assessment of the deep soft-tissues. CT angiography and conventional arteriography are helpful for assessment of vascular injury, and bone scintigraphy can be used in assessment of complex regional pain syndrome after traumatic shoulder injury. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.','2018-05-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00',0,0,'Expert Panel on Musculoskeletal Imaging:|Amini, Behrang, B|Beckmann, Nicholas M, NM|Beaman, Francesca D, FD|Wessell, Daniel E, DE|Bernard, Stephanie A, SA|Cassidy, R Carter, RC|Czuczman, Gregory J, GJ|Demertzis, Jennifer L, JL|Greenspan, Bennett S, BS|Khurana, Bharti, B|Lee, Kenneth S, KS|Lenchik, Leon, L|Motamedi, Kambiz, K|Sharma, Akash, A|Walker, Eric A, EA|Kransdorf, Mark J, MJ','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(139,14,29715519,'1528-8447','Oxidative stress contributes to fracture/cast-induced inflammation and pain in a rat model of complex regional pain syndrome.','Clinical evidence suggests vitamin C (Vit C) may protect against the development of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) after fracture and/or surgery. Tibia fracture followed by 4 weeks cast immobilization (fracture/cast) in rats results in nociceptive, vascular, and bone changes resembling clinical CRPS. In the present study, fracture/cast rats were treated with the oxidative stress inhibitors Vit C, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) to examine their effects on CRPS-related nociceptive and vascular changes. Administration of these agents significantly reduced fracture/cast-induced cutaneous allodynia by 64-78%, muscle hyperalgesia by 34-40% and hindlimb unweighting by 48-89%. Treatments with Vit C and NAC reduced the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde in the skin, muscle and sciatic nerve, and lactate in the gastrocnemius muscle of the fracture/cast limb. Furthermore, Vit C treatment inhibited the post fracture up-regulation of SP and CGRP in the sciatic nerve and the increased expression of the pain-related inflammatory mediators, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the skin and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 in the muscle of the post fracture/cast limb. These data suggest that oxidative stress may contribute to the nociceptive features of the rat CRPS model.Vit C reduced the CRPS-like signs, oxidative stress, and the up regulation of neuropeptide production and inflammatory mediators observed after tibia fracture and casting in rats. Limiting oxidative stress using Vit C or alternative strategies could reduce the risk of developing CRPS after surgery or other forms of trauma.','2018-04-28 00:00:00','2018-04-28 00:00:00','2018-05-08 00:00:00',0,0,'Guo, Tian-Zhi, TZ|Wei, Tzuping, T|Huang, Ting-Ting, TT|Kingery, Wade S, WS|Clark, John David, JD','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(140,15,29750111,'2052-6687','Demography and disorders of the French Bulldog population under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2013.','Despite its Gallic name, the French Bulldog is a breed of both British and French origin that was first recognised by The Kennel Club in 1906. The French Bulldog has demonstrated recent rapid rises in Kennel Club registrations and is now (2017) the second most commonly registered pedigree breed in the UK. However, the breed has been reported to be predisposed to several disorders including ocular, respiratory, neurological and dermatological problems. The VetCompass™ Programme collates de-identified clinical data from primary-care veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. Using VetCompass™ clinical data, this study aimed to characterise the demography and common disorders of the general population of French Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK.French Bulldogs comprised 2228 (0.49%) of 445,557 study dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Annual proportional birth rates showed that the proportional ownership of French Bulldog puppies rose steeply from 0.02% of the annual birth cohort attending VetCompass™ practices in 2003 to 1.46% in 2013. The median age of the French Bulldogs overall was 1.3 years (IQR 0.6-2.5, range 0.0-13.0). The most common colours of French Bulldogs were brindle (solid or main) (32.36%) and fawn (solid or main) (29.9%). Of the 2228 French Bulldogs under veterinary care during 2013, 1612 (72.4%) had at least one disorder recorded. The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6-15.5), diarrhoea (7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4-8.7), conjunctivitis (3.2%, 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), nails overlong (3.1%, 95% CI% 2.4-3.9) and skin fold dermatitis (3.0%, 95% CI% 2.3-3.8). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (17.9%, 95% CI: 16.3-19.6), enteropathy (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.2-18.3), aural (16.3%, 95% CI: 14.8-17.9), upper respiratory tract (12.7%, 95% CI: 11.3-14.1) and ophthalmological (10.5%, 95% CI: 9.3-11.9).Ownership of French Bulldogs in the UK is rising steeply. This means that the disorder profiles reported in this study reflect a current young UK population and are likely to shift as this cohort ages. Otitis externa, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis were the most common disorders in French Bulldogs. Identification of health priorities based on VetCompass™ data can support evidence-based reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'O\'Neill, Dan G, DG|Baral, Lauren, L|Church, David B, DB|Brodbelt, Dave C, DC|Packer, Rowena M A, RMA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(141,15,29735865,'1119-3077','The prevalence of allergic diseases among children with asthma: What is the impact on asthma control in South East Nigeria?','Allergic diseases are known to occur in children with asthma and its coexistence with asthma may impact on asthma control in affected children living in a low-income country.

Poxviruses are remarkable for their unique replication cycle, which is restricted to the cytoplasm of infected cells. The independence from the host nucleus requires poxviruses to encode most of the enzymes involved in DNA replication, transcription and processing. Here, we use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system to induce DNA damage to VACV (strain Western Reserve) genomes. We show that targeting CRISPR/Cas9 to essential viral genes limits virus replication efficiently. Although VACV is a strictly cytoplasmic pathogen, we observed extensive viral genome editing at the target site; this is reminiscent of a non-homologous end-joining DNA repair mechanism. This pathway was not dependent on the viral DNA ligase, but critically involved the cellular DNA ligase IV. Our data show that DNA ligase IV can act outside of the nucleus to allow repair of dsDNA breaks in poxvirus genomes.

During the past six decades, CPXV infection has been extensively researched and described in both domestic (cat, dog, horse, cattle) and zoo animals (e. g. elephant, rhinoceros, okapi). Of note, a review of the literature produced only three reports of CPXV in individual or small groups of South American camelids. The goal of this review was to describe the current knowledge as it relates to clinical features of CPXV infection in South American camelids and to compare the clinical manifestations with those described in other animal species. In alpacas and llamas, virus transmission occurs via direct contact with infected animals or oronasal infection through microlesions in the skin and mucous membranes. In its mild form, the disease is limited to certain regions of the body (head, neck, extremities or perineal region) and characterised by pustules or crusts. CPXV infection can also cause generalised and frequently lethal disease with multifocal to diffuse skin lesions (papules, pustules, crusts, ulcers) accompanied by virus replication in other organs. Conjunctivitis, stomatitis and rhinitis are seen commonly together with nonspecific clinical signs, including anorexia, listlessness and fever. As in other poxvirus infections, factors leading to an immunosuppression may contribute to the development of the clinical ma -nifestation of CPXV infection.

The central cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS activates STING, which is phosphorylated, dimerises and translocates from the ER to a perinuclear region to mediate IRF-3 activation. Poxviruses are dsDNA viruses replicating in the cytosol and hence likely to trigger cytosolic DNA sensing. Here we investigated the activation of innate immune signalling by 4 different strains of the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) in a cell line proficient in DNA sensing. Infection with the attenuated VACV strain MVA activated IRF-3 via cGAS and STING, and accordingly STING dimerised and was phosphorylated during MVA infection. Conversely, VACV strains Copenhagen and Western Reserve inhibited STING dimerisation and phosphorylation during infection and in response to transfected DNA and cGAMP, thus efficiently suppressing DNA sensing and IRF-3 activation. A VACV deletion mutant lacking protein C16, thought to be the only viral DNA sensing inhibitor acting upstream of STING, retained the ability to block STING activation. Similar inhibition of DNA-induced STING activation was also observed for cowpox and ectromelia viruses. Our data demonstrate that virulent poxviruses possess mechanisms for targeting DNA sensing at the level of the cGAS-STING axis and that these mechanisms do not operate in replication-defective strains such as MVA. These findings shed light on the role of cellular DNA sensing in poxvirus-host interactions and will open new avenues to determine its impact on VACV immunogenicity and virulence. Poxviruses are dsDNA viruses infecting a wide range of vertebrates and include the causative agent of smallpox (variola virus) and its vaccine vaccinia virus (VACV). Despite smallpox eradication VACV remains of interest as a therapeutic. Attenuated strains are popular vaccine candidates, whereas replication-competent strains are emerging as efficient oncolytics in virotherapy. The successful therapeutic use of VACV depends on a detailed understanding of its ability to modulate host innate immune responses. DNA sensing is a critical cellular mechanism for pathogen detection and activation of innate immunity that is centrally coordinated by the ER-resident protein STING. Here STING is shown to mediate immune activation in response to MVA, but not to virulent VACV strains or other virulent poxviruses, which prevent STING activation and DNA sensing during infection and after DNA transfection. These results provide new insights into poxvirus immune evasion and have implications in the rational design of VACV-based therapeutics.','2018-02-28 00:00:00','2018-02-28 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Georgana, Iliana, I|Sumner, Rebecca P, RP|Towers, Greg J, GJ|Maluquer de Motes, Carlos, C','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(154,16,29446492,'1096-9071','Bayesian reconstruction of the evolutionary history and cross-species transition of variola virus and orthopoxviruses.','Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, is an exclusively human virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes many other viral species covering a wide range of mammal hosts, such as vaccinia, cowpox, camelpox, taterapox, ectromelia, and monkeypox virus. The tempo and mode of evolution of Orthopoxviruses were reconstructed using a Bayesian phylodynamic framework by analysing 80 hemagglutinin sequences retrieved from public databases. Bayesian phylogeography was used to estimate their putative ancestral hosts. In order to estimate the substitution rate, the tree including all of the available Orthopoxviruses was calibrated using historical references dating the South American variola minor clade (alastrim) to between the XVI and XIX century. The mean substitution rate determined by the analysis was 6.5 × 10 substitutions/site/year. Based on this evolutionary estimate, the time of the most recent common ancestor of the genus Orthopoxvirus was placed at about 10 000 years before the present. Cowpox virus was the species closest to the root of the phylogenetic tree. The root of VARV circulating in the XX century was estimated to be about 700 years ago, corresponding to about 1300 AD. The divergence between West African and South American VARV went back about 500 years ago (falling approximately in the XVI century). A rodent species is the most probable ancestral host from which the ancestors of all the known Orthopoxviruses were transmitted to the other mammal host species, and each of these species represented a dead-end for each new poxvirus species, without any further inter-specific spread.','2018-06-01 00:00:00','2018-03-12 00:00:00','2018-04-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Zehender, Gianguglielmo, G|Lai, Alessia, A|Veo, Carla, C|Bergna, Annalisa, A|Ciccozzi, Massimo, M|Galli, Massimo, M','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(155,16,29444189,'1553-7374','Cross-priming induces immunodomination in the presence of viral MHC class I inhibition.','Viruses have evolved mechanisms of MHCI inhibition in order to evade recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), which is well-illustrated by our prior studies on cowpox virus (CPXV) that encodes potent MHCI inhibitors. Deletion of CPXV viral MHCI inhibitors markedly attenuated in vivo infection due to effects on CTL effector function, not priming. However, the CTL response to CPXV in C57BL/6 mice is dominated by a single peptide antigen presented by H-2Kb. Here we evaluated the effect of viral MHCI inhibition on immunodominant (IDE) and subdominant epitopes (SDE) as this has not been thoroughly examined. We found that cross-priming, but not cross-dressing, is the main mechanism driving IDE and SDE CTL responses following CPXV infection. Secretion of the immunodominant antigen was not required for immunodominance. Instead, immunodominance was caused by CTL interference, known as immunodomination. Both immunodomination and cross-priming of SDEs were not affected by MHCI inhibition. SDE-specific CTLs were also capable of exerting immunodomination during primary and secondary responses, which was in part dependent on antigen abundance. Furthermore, CTL responses directed solely against SDEs protected against lethal CPXV infection, but only in the absence of the CPXV MHCI inhibitors. Thus, both SDE and IDE responses can contribute to protective immunity against poxviruses, implying that these principles apply to poxvirus-based vaccines.','2018-02-01 00:00:00','2018-02-14 00:00:00','2018-03-01 00:00:00',0,0,'Lauron, Elvin J, EJ|Yang, Liping, L|Elliott, Jabari I, JI|Gainey, Maria D, MD|Fremont, Daved H, DH|Yokoyama, Wayne M, WM','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(156,16,29427674,'1872-9096','Phage display antibodies against ectromelia virus that neutralize variola virus: Selection and implementation for p35 neutralizing epitope mapping.','In this study, five phage display antibodies (pdAbs) against ectromelia virus (ECTV) were selected from vaccinia virus (VACV)-immune phage-display library of human single chain variable fragments (scFv).

The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.','2018-01-29 00:00:00','2018-01-29 00:00:00','2018-02-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Grossegesse, Marica, M|Doellinger, Joerg, J|Fritsch, Annemarie, A|Laue, Michael, M|Piesker, Janett, J|Schaade, Lars, L|Nitsche, Andreas, A','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(160,17,29753298,'1872-6976','Balance ability and cognitive impairment influence sustained walking in an assisted living facility.','The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of cognitive impairment (CI), gait quality, and balance ability on walking distance and speed in an assisted living facility.This was a longitudinal cohort study of institutionalized older adults (N = 26; 555 observations) followed for up to 8 months. Hierarchical linear modeling statistical techniques were used to examine the effects of gait quality and balance ability (using the Tinetti Gait and Balance Test) and cognitive status (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) on walking activity (distance, sustained distance, sustained speed). The latter were measured objectively and continuously by a real-time locating system (RTLS).A one-point increase in balance ability was associated with an 8% increase in sustained walking distance (p = 0.03) and a 4% increase in sustained gait speed (p = 0.00).

Previous studies have shown that minocycline, an antibiotic, can inhibit DENV infection in vitro. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. It is known that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is involved in dengue disease development; MIF can induce autophagy, and autophagy can facilitate DENV replication. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that MIF-induced autophagy is involved in minocycline treatment against DENV infection. We first showed that DENV infection induced MIF secretion and autophagy flux in HuH-7 cells. Suppression of endogenous MIF by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and inhibition of MIF by its inhibitors attenuated DENV replication and autophagy formation. In addition, minocycline treatment suppressed DENV-induced MIF secretion and autophagy in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that minocycline treatment attenuated viral load, MIF secretion, autophagy and increase survival in DENV-infected mice. These results suggest that inhibition of MIF-induced autophagy by minocycline might represent an alternative therapeutic approach against DENV infection.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Lai, Yen-Chung, YC|Chuang, Yung-Chun, YC|Chang, Chih-Peng, CP|Lin, Yee-Shin, YS|Perng, Guey-Chuen, GC|Wu, Han-Chung, HC|Hsieh, Shie-Liang, SL|Yeh, Trai-Ming, TM','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(171,18,29752023,'1873-2518','Decreased accumulation of subgenomic RNA in human cells infected with vaccine candidate DEN4Δ30 increases viral susceptibility to type I interferon.','The NIH has developed live attenuated dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidates by deletion of 30 nucleotides (Δ30) from the untranslated region of the viral genome.

As both viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito-species, their distributions largely overlap and reliable serological distinction between the viruses is essential. Here we develop a novel biosensor which is based on recombinant forms of ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII). Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV), we demonstrate that in addition to extremely sensitive detection of ZIKV-specific antibodies in serum and saliva, the biosensor promptly distinguished ZIKV and DENV-specific antibodies.

During outbreak situations, many cases of Dengue (DEN) and Chikungunya (CHIK) are reported. In such scenario, vector mosquitoes are likely to get co-infection/secondary-infection with one or other virus. The present study was carried out to determine the susceptibility of Indian strain of Aedes aegypti to Zika virus (ZIKV) strain (MR-766) and the effect of co-infection/super-infection with either dengue virus (serotype-2) (DENV) or chikungunya virus (CHIKV) on ZIKV replication.Ae. aegypti mosquitoes used in this study were reared for many generations since 1980 at laboratory colony maintained at the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. Transmissibility of ZIKV from infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was also studied. Mosquitoes were experimentally infected with ZIKV and super-infected with either DENV or CHIKV via membrane-feeding route and incubated for 14 days at 28±2°C and humidity of 85±5 per cent. Replication of these viruses in mosquitoes was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assay. Twenty infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed upon four suckling CD1 mice for about 30 min. Transmission of the ZIKV by infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was confirmed by the appearance of clinical signs and the presence of viral RNA in different organs.Concomitant infection of mosquitoes with all the three viruses showed simultaneous propagation of all three viruses, confirmed by real time RT-PCR and IFA. Infection of mosquitoes with CHIKV followed by ZIKV showed positivity in individual head squashes (7%) for both viruses using IFA; only 8.3 per cent showed dual positivity with primary infection of ZIKV followed by DENV; 8.3 per cent dual infection positivity was observed when infected with DENV followed by ZIKV; 5 per cent showed dual infection was observed when infected with ZIKV followed by CHIKV. Ae. aegypti was found to be susceptible to ZIKV strain as ZIKV could be detected from the second post-infection day (PID) in infected mosquitoes. Transmission of ZIKV to mice by the bite of infected Ae. aegypti establishes this species as a potential vector.From super-infection experiments, it was concluded that ZIKV might have a relative advantage in replication dynamics over DENV. Vertical transmission was not observed for ZIKV in experimentally infected mosquitoes (n=920 larvae).

Dupilumab is a new and promising targeted biologic medication approved for use in adults with more severe atopic dermatitis; however, additional research is needed to determine whether this medication should be incorporated more broadly into management of severe childhood atopic dermatitis.Atopic dermatitis management involves early diagnosis, skin barrier function support, mitigation of cutaneous inflammation, and concomitant risk stratification for the development of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and environmental allergies.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Shaker, Marcus, M|Murray, Robert G P, RGP|Mann, Julianne A, JA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(186,19,29750111,'2052-6687','Demography and disorders of the French Bulldog population under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2013.','Despite its Gallic name, the French Bulldog is a breed of both British and French origin that was first recognised by The Kennel Club in 1906. The French Bulldog has demonstrated recent rapid rises in Kennel Club registrations and is now (2017) the second most commonly registered pedigree breed in the UK. However, the breed has been reported to be predisposed to several disorders including ocular, respiratory, neurological and dermatological problems. The VetCompass™ Programme collates de-identified clinical data from primary-care veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. Using VetCompass™ clinical data, this study aimed to characterise the demography and common disorders of the general population of French Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK.French Bulldogs comprised 2228 (0.49%) of 445,557 study dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Annual proportional birth rates showed that the proportional ownership of French Bulldog puppies rose steeply from 0.02% of the annual birth cohort attending VetCompass™ practices in 2003 to 1.46% in 2013. The median age of the French Bulldogs overall was 1.3 years (IQR 0.6-2.5, range 0.0-13.0). The most common colours of French Bulldogs were brindle (solid or main) (32.36%) and fawn (solid or main) (29.9%). Of the 2228 French Bulldogs under veterinary care during 2013, 1612 (72.4%) had at least one disorder recorded. The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6-15.5), diarrhoea (7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4-8.7), conjunctivitis (3.2%, 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), nails overlong (3.1%, 95% CI% 2.4-3.9) and skin fold dermatitis (3.0%, 95% CI% 2.3-3.8). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (17.9%, 95% CI: 16.3-19.6), enteropathy (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.2-18.3), aural (16.3%, 95% CI: 14.8-17.9), upper respiratory tract (12.7%, 95% CI: 11.3-14.1) and ophthalmological (10.5%, 95% CI: 9.3-11.9).Ownership of French Bulldogs in the UK is rising steeply. This means that the disorder profiles reported in this study reflect a current young UK population and are likely to shift as this cohort ages. Otitis externa, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis were the most common disorders in French Bulldogs. Identification of health priorities based on VetCompass™ data can support evidence-based reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'O\'Neill, Dan G, DG|Baral, Lauren, L|Church, David B, DB|Brodbelt, Dave C, DC|Packer, Rowena M A, RMA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(187,19,29749768,'0966-0461','Incontinence-associated dermatitis from a urinary incontinence perspective.','This article looks at incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) from the perspective of urinary incontinence (UI).

PAH clinical diagnosis remains an exclusion diagnosis. We aimed to correlate PAH neuro-radiological signs to endocrine features and evaluate their prognostic role. 24 PAH cases were enrolled and classified according to neuro-radiological signs: in 12 adeno-hypophysitis (AHs), 8 infundibulo-neuro-hypophysitis (INHs) and 4 pan-hypophysitis (PHs). Secondary hypogonadism developed more frequently in INHs as compared to AHs (54.5% vs. 27.3%, p = 0.05), without no difference with PHs (p = 0.6). Diabetes insipidus occurred more frequently in INHs cases (72.7%, p < 0.001) and in PHs cases (27.3%, p = 0.007), as compared to AHs cases (0%). Similarly, all cases of GHD occurred in INHs (100%) as compared to AHs (0%, p < 0.001) and PHs (0%, p < 0.001). The pituitary stalk (PS) showed a pseudo-triangular shape (larger at the optical chiasma) in INHs and a pseudo-cylindrical shape (larger both at the optical chiasma and at the pituitary insertion) in PHs. The PS pseudo-triangular shape correlated to the occurrence of GHD and diabetes insipidus (p < 0.001/p = 0.03). At the 1-year follow-up, improvement of baseline radiological features positively correlated with the loss of the neuro-pituitary \"bright spot\" on T1-weighted images (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03-0.9 p = 0.02) and with a PS diameter at the optical chiasma level larger than 4.1 mm (AUC 0.97, sensibility 80%, specificity 100%, OR 6; 95% CI1.1-28.8, p = 0.01) Our data suggest that neuro-radiological PAH classification in PH, AH and INH can predict pituitary dysfunction and that some neuro-radiological features, such as the pituitary stalk diameter and the loss of the neuro-pituitary bright spot on T1w images can play a role as a positive prognostic marker of the radiological hypophysitis outcome.','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Tartaglione, Tommaso, T|Chiloiro, Sabrina, S|Laino, Maria Elena, ME|Giampietro, Antonella, A|Gaudino, Simona, S|Zoli, Angelo, A|Bianchi, Antonio, A|Pontecorvi, Alfredo, A|Colosimo, Cesare, C|De Marinis, Laura, L','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(191,20,29752488,'1433-0350','Open resection of hypothalamic hamartomas for intractable epilepsy revisited, using intraoperative MRI.','Hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) are rare non-neoplastic lesions which cause drug-resistant epilepsy with associated behavioural, psychiatric and endocrine issues.

Despite treatment with insulin therapy, glycemic goals are not always met, and insulin therapy is sometimes limited by adverse effects, including hypoglycemia and weight gain. Several adjunctive therapies have been evaluated in combination with insulin in patients with T1DM to improve glycemic control while minimizing adverse effects. Pramlintide, an amylin analog, can improve glycemic control, primarily through lowering postprandial blood glucose levels. Patients may experience weight loss and an increased risk of hypoglycemia and require additional mealtime injections. Metformin provides an inexpensive, oral treatment option and may reduce blood glucose, especially in overweight or obese patients with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin may be more effective in patients with impaired insulin sensitivity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce primarily postprandial blood glucose and insulin dose and promote weight loss. They are expensive, cause transient nausea, may increase risk of hypoglycemia and require additional injections. Sodium-glucose transport-2 inhibitors improve glycemic control, promote weight loss and have low risk of hypoglycemia with appropriate insulin adjustment; however, these agents may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with T1DM. Patient-specific characteristics should be considered when selecting adjunctive therapy for patients with T1DM.

The vitreous amino acids were estimated in PDR (Proliferative diabetic retinopathy) and MH (Macular Hole) as disease control using HPLC. Bovine retinal pericytes (BRP) were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with 0.5 mM of any one of the individual amino acids (proline, hydroxyproline, phenylalanine, alanine, serine, glycine, lysine, isoleucine or valine) along with 100 nM insulin for 14 days in high glucose (25 mM) condition. The mRNA expression profile of adipogenic markers (such as Pref1, APN, ZAG and PPARγ), angiogenic markers (VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9, TGF-β) and antioxidant markers (Nrf2 and UCP-2) were evaluated by qPCR. Adipogenesis was further confirmed by adipogenesis assay, secretion of adiponectin in medium and triglyceride accumulation by Oil red O staining in Bovine retinal pericytes.Amino acids valine (p < 0.004), isoleucine (p < 0.0007), leucine (p < 0.022), serine (p < 0.0007), glycine (p < 0.001), alanine (p < 0.017), phenylalanine (p < 0.013), and lysine (p < 0.001) were significantly elevated in the vitreous of PDR group (n = 30) when compared to macular hole (n = 20).

TGFβ mRNA expression showed a significant decrease with proline, alanine, glycine, lysine and isoleucine. The Nrf2 expression was significantly increased in alanine and serine when compared to control. The UCP-2 gene showed a significant increase in proline and lysine treatment.Our results suggest that amino acids hydroxyproline, proline, lysine, glycine and alanine which are elevated in the PDR vitreous show a tendency to induce adipogenic effects in retinal pericytes by triggering the accumulation of triglycerides and adiponectin. Hence we hypothesize that these aminoacids when elevated along with insulin and glucose can induce metabolic changes in pericytes. The functional implications of these changes tend to be protective as it increases the antioxidant potential and decreases the angiogenesis markers which are potentially pathogenic.','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Vidhya, S, S|Ramya, R, R|Coral, K, K|Sulochana, K N, KN|Bharathidevi, S R, SR','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(211,22,29752167,'1878-1780','Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use and risk of diabetic retinopathy: A population-based study.','This study examined whether dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor use is beneficial or harmful to diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared with other glucose-lowering agents in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).From a population-based cohort provided by the National Health Insurance Service in Korea, 67,743 adults with T2D were identified as having been treated with oral glucose-lowering agents between 2008 and 2013.

The results revealed that miR‑219‑5p was significantly upregulated by high glucose (HG) treatment. To explore the role and mechanism of miR‑219‑5p in DR progression, miR‑219‑5p was downregulated in ARPE‑19 cells.

Age- and sex-specific causes of low vision and blindness were identified.Bilateral low vision and blindness was detected in 347 people, 172 males and 175 females. For those aged 18-50 years, retinal dystrophies (37%), congenital eye anomalies (14%) and myopic degenerations (13%) were the most common causes. For those aged 50+ years, age-related macular degeneration (21%) was the leading cause. Diabetic retinopathy (17%), corneal opacities (14%), cataract (12%) and glaucoma (9%) were also important. Sex was not a significant determinant.The specific causes of visual impairment vary greatly with age, however, unavoidable retinal pathologies were the predominant causes at all ages.','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Koç, Feray, F|Erden, Veysi, V|Sefi-Yurdakul, Nazife, N','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(218,22,29747621,'1471-2415','Prevalence and clinical characteristics of dry eye disease in community-based type 2 diabetic patients: the Beixinjing eye study.','This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of dry eye disease (DED) in community-based type 2 diabetic patients and to identify the associated factors related with DED.A total of 1360 type 2 diabetic patients in the Beixinjing community were randomly selected.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to protect the diabetic retina in the early stage of DR; however, the relationship between GLP-1 and retinal pericytes has not been discussed. In this study, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) significantly increased the migration of primary bovine retinal pericytes without influencing cell viability. AGEs also significantly enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation, and changed the expressions of migration-related proteins, including phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and vinculin. PI3K inhibition significantly attenuated the AGEs-induced migration of retinal pericytes and reversed the overexpression of MMP-2. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) was expressed in retinal pericytes, and liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, significantly attenuated the migration of pericytes by Glp1r and reversed the changes in p-Akt/Akt, p-FAK/FAK, vinculin and MMP-2 levels induced by AGEs, indicating that the protective effect of liraglutide was associated with the PI3K/Akt pathway. These results provided new insights into the mechanism underlying retinal pericyte migration. The early use of liraglutide exerts a potential bebefical effect on regulating pericyte migration, which might contribute to mechanisms that maintain the integrity of vascular barrier and delay the development of DR.','2018-05-07 00:00:00','2018-05-07 00:00:00','2018-05-10 00:00:00',0,0,'Lin, Wen-Jian, WJ|Ma, Xue-Fei, XF|Hao, Ming, M|Zhou, Huan-Ran, HR|Yu, Xin-Yang, XY|Shao, Ning, N|Gao, Xin-Yuan, XY|Kuang, Hong-Yu, HY','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(220,23,29752274,'1098-5336','Molecular epidemiology of Shiga toxin-producing  (STEC) on New Zealand dairy farms: application of a culture-independent assay and whole genome sequencing.','No abstract found.','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00',0,0,'Browne, A Springer, AS|Midwinter, Anne C, AC|Withers, Helen, H|Cookson, Adrian L, AL|Biggs, Patrick J, PJ|Marshall, Jonathan C, JC|Benschop, Jackie, J|Hathaway, Steve, S|Haack, Neville A, NA|Akhter, Rukhshana N, RN|French, Nigel P, NP','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(221,23,29752199,'2352-3026','Gemcitabine-oxaliplatin plus rituximab (R-GemOx) as first-line treatment in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.','The combination of rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) has shown high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in elderly patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Findings from animal studies suggest that choline supplementation during pregnancy may mitigate adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth and neurocognitive function. We conducted a randomized, double-blind exploratory trial to examine feasibility and acceptability of a choline supplementation intervention during pregnancy.70 heavy drinkers, recruited in mid-pregnancy, were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of 2g of choline or a placebo from time of enrollment until delivery. Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with water, produced a sweet tasting grape-flavored drink. Adherence was assessed by collecting used and unused drink packets on a monthly basis and tabulating the number used. Side effects were assessed in monthly interviews. Blood samples obtained at enrollment and at 4 and 12 weeks after randomization were assayed for plasma choline concentration.Adherence was good-to-excellent (median doses taken=74.0%; interquartile range=53.9-88.7%) and was not related to a range of sociodemographic characteristics or to alcohol consumption ascertained using a timeline follow-back interview. By 4 weeks, plasma choline concentrations were significantly higher in the choline supplementation than the placebo arm, and this group difference continued to be evident at 12 weeks. The only side effect was a small increase in nausea/dyspepsia. No effects were seen for diarrhea, vomiting, muscle stiffness, blood pressure, or body odor changes.This study demonstrated that a choline supplementation program with very heavy drinkers during pregnancy is feasible even among highly disadvantaged, poorly educated women. The broad acceptability of this intervention is indicated by our finding that adherence was not related to maternal education, intellectual function, depression, nutritional status, or alcohol use.

For the purpose of improving a wide range of psychiatric symptoms with patients affected by panic disorder, it may be useful to pay more attention to this personal trait at baseline.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-03-12 00:00:00','2018-05-07 00:00:00',0,0,'Ogawa, Sei, S|Kondo, Masaki, M|Ino, Keiko, K|Imai, Risa, R|Ii, Toshitaka, T|Furukawa, Toshi A, TA|Akechi, Tatsuo, T','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(232,24,29713294,'1664-0640','Characteristics and Pathways of Long-Stay Patients in High and Medium Secure Settings in England; A Secondary Publication From a Large Mixed-Methods Study.','No abstract found.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-04-16 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00',0,0,'Völlm, Birgit A, BA|Edworthy, Rachel, R|Huband, Nick, N|Talbot, Emily, E|Majid, Shazmin, S|Holley, Jessica, J|Furtado, Vivek, V|Weaver, Tim, T|McDonald, Ruth, R|Duggan, Conor, C','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(233,24,29702176,'1872-7549','Bipolar affective disorder and borderline personality disorder: Differentiation based on the history of early life stress and psychoneuroendocrine measures.','Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Bipolar Affective Disorder (BD) have clinical characteristics in common which often make their differential diagnosis difficult. The history of early life stress (ELS) may be a differentiating factor between BPD and BD, as well as its association with clinical manifestations and specific neuroendocrine responses in each of these diagnoses.Assessing and comparing patients with BD and BPD for factors related to symptomatology, etiopathogenesis and neuroendocrine markers.The study sample consisted of 51 women, divided into 3 groups: patients with a clinical diagnosis of BPD (n = 20) and BD (n = 16) and healthy controls (HC, n = 15). Standardized instruments were used for the clinical evaluation, while the history of ELS was quantified with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and classified according to the subtypes: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect. The functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was evaluated by measuring a single plasma cortisol sample.Patients with BPD presented with more severe psychiatric symptoms of: anxiety, impulsivity, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation than those with BD. The history of ELS was identified as significantly more prevalent and more severe in patients (BPD and BP) than in HC. Emotional abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect also showed differences and were higher in BPD than BD patients. BPD patients had greater severity of ELS overall and in the subtypes of emotional abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect than BD patients. The presence of ELS in patients with BPD and BP showed significant difference with lower cortisol levels when compared to HC. The endocrine evaluation showed no significant differences between the diagnoses of BPD and BD. Cortisol measured in patients with BPD was significantly lower compared to HC in the presence of emotional neglect and physical neglect. A significant negative correlation between the severity of hopelessness vs cortisol; and physical neglect vs cortisol were found in BPD with ELS. The single cortisol sample showed a significant and opposite correlations in the sexual abuse diagnosis-related groups, being a negative correlation in BD and positive in BPD.Considering the need for a multi-factorial analysis, the differential diagnosis between BPD and BD can be facilitated by the study of psychiatric symptoms, which is more severe in the BPD patients with a history of early life stress. The function of the HPA axis assessed by this cortisol measure suggests differences between BPD and BP with ELS history.The integrated analysis of psychopathology, ELS and neuroendocrine function may provide useful indicators to differentiate BPD and BD diagnoses. These preliminary data need to be replicated in a more significant sample with a better assessment and multiple assessments of the HPA axis activity.','2018-04-24 00:00:00','2018-04-24 00:00:00','2018-04-27 00:00:00',0,0,'Mazer, Angela Kaline, AK|Cleare, Anthony J, AJ|Young, Allan H, AH|Juruena, Mario F, MF','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(234,24,29648858,'1939-2117','The effect of alliance-focused training on a cognitive-behavioral therapy for personality disorders.','To improve success rates in psychotherapy, we developed and evaluated an alliance-focused training (AFT) protocol with regard to patient-therapist interpersonal behavior in a 30-session protocol of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for outpatients comorbid with Axis I and II conditions.Participants included 40 patients treated by 40 therapists in a multiple baseline design in which novice therapists trained to fidelity standards in CBT were introduced to AFT at different time intervals (after either 8 or 16 sessions) during a 30-session CBT protocol. Interpersonal behaviors were assessed with a simplified version of the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) on videotaped sessions sampled from the early (between Sessions 6 through 8), mid (Sessions 14 through 16), and late (Sessions 22 through 24) phases of therapy.As predicted, several significant interactions were observed between within-subject interpersonal change and between-groups differences in exposure to AFT. Specifically, there were decreases in patient dependence and in therapist control (including criticism), plus increases in patient expressiveness and in therapist affirmation and expressiveness, all of which could be attributed to AFT. The predictive relationship of several of these variables to session-level and overall treatment outcome was also demonstrated.This study demonstrates that novice CBT therapists can be trained to improve their interpersonal process with patients who present with comorbid diagnoses, including a personality disorder.

Despite the prevalence and gravity of mental disorders, our knowledge concerning everyday challenges associated with them is relatively limited. One of the most studied deficits related to everyday challenges is language impairment, yet we do not know how mental disorders can impact common forms of written communication, for example, social media.The aims of this study were to investigate written communication challenges manifest in online mental health communities focusing on depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the impact of participating in these online mental health communities on written communication. As the control, we selected three online health communities focusing on positive emotion, exercising, and weight management.We examined lexical diversity and readability, both important features for measuring the quality of writing. We used four well-established readability metrics that consider word frequencies and syntactic complexity to measure writers\' written communication ability. We then measured the lexical diversity by calculating the percentage of unique words in posts. To compare lexical diversity and readability among communities, we first applied pairwise independent sample t tests, followed by P value adjustments using the prespecified Hommel procedure to adjust for multiple comparison. To measure the changes, we applied linear least squares regression to the readability and lexical diversity scores against the interaction sequence for each member, followed by pairwise independent sample t tests and P value adjustments. Given the large sample of members, we also report effect sizes and 95% CIs for the pairwise comparisons.On average, members of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia communities showed indications of difficulty expressing their ideas compared with three other online health communities. Our results also suggest that participating in these platforms has the potential to improve members\' written communication. For example, members of all three mental health communities showed statistically significant improvement in both lexical diversity and readability compared with members of the OHC focusing on positive emotion.We provide new insights into the written communication challenges faced by individuals suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. A comparison with three other online health communities suggests that written communication in mental health communities is significantly more difficult to read, while also consisting of a significantly less diverse lexicon. We contribute practical suggestions for utilizing our findings in Web-based communication settings to enhance members\' communicative experience. We consider these findings to be an important step toward understanding and addressing everyday written communication challenges among individuals suffering from mental disorders.','2018-04-10 00:00:00','2018-04-10 00:00:00','2018-05-04 00:00:00',0,0,'Park, Albert, A|Conway, Mike, M','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(236,24,29609713,'1550-9397','Dissociative Identity Disorder CPAP Adherence: An Uncommon Factor in Obstructive Sleep Apnea.','We present a case of a patient with dissociative identity disorder and symptomatic sleep apnea who was treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The association between loneliness and mental health indices may partly be due to inherited biological factors. We constructed polygenic scores for 27 traits related to behavior, cognition and mental health and tested their prediction for self-reported loneliness in a population-based sample of 8798 Dutch individuals. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were significantly associated with loneliness. Of the Big Five personality dimensions, polygenic scores for neuroticism and conscientiousness also significantly predicted loneliness, as did the polygenic scores for subjective well-being, tiredness and self-rated health. When including all polygenic scores simultaneously into one model, only 2 major depression polygenic scores remained as significant predictors of loneliness. When controlling only for these 2 MDD polygenic scores, only neuroticism and schizophrenia remain significant. The total variation explained by all polygenic scores collectively was 1.7%. The association between the propensity to feel lonely and the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders thus pointed to a shared genetic etiology. The predictive power of polygenic scores will increase as the power of the genome-wide association studies on which they are based increases and may lead to clinically useful polygenic scores that can inform on the genetic predisposition to loneliness and mental health.','2018-03-23 00:00:00','2018-03-23 00:00:00','2018-04-15 00:00:00',0,0,'Abdellaoui, A, A|Nivard, M G, MG|Hottenga, J-J, JJ|Fedko, I, I|Verweij, K J H, KJH|Baselmans, B M L, BML|Ehli, E A, EA|Davies, G E, GE|Bartels, M, M|Boomsma, D I, DI|Cacioppo, J T, JT','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(238,24,29547739,'2352-2518','Good psychiatric management: a review.','Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has moved from being an untreatable disorder to a disorder with multiple evidence-based psychotherapies.

Among 1150 studies that were screened, 6 studies had sufficient longitudinal data points to qualify for meaningful inclusion, yielding 255 pregnancies in 133 women after Fontan procedure resulting in 115 live births (45%; including reports from 1986 to 2015). There was a total of 137 pregnancy losses (69%), with 115 miscarriages (45%), 19 elective terminations of pregnancy (7%), 2 stillbirths (1%), and 1 ectopic pregnancy (1%).The most common cardiovascular adverse events were supraventricular arrhythmia affecting 8.4% (range, 3%-37%) and heart failure affecting 3.9% (range, 3%-11%) of pregnancies. These complications were successfully managed with conventional approaches. No maternal deaths were reported. Postpartum hemorrhage was the predominant obstetric complication affecting 14% of the patients. Most patients were on antiplatelet agents (27%) or anticoagulants (50%) whereas only a minority (11%) were on neither. Among the 115 live births, 68 were premature (59%), 17 were small for gestational age (20%), and neonatal death occurred in 6 patients (5%).The most commonly reported cardiovascular complications in patients with Fontan physiology-associated pregnancy were arrhythmia and heart failure. Miscarriages were highly prevalent as was prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. Postpartum hemorrhage seems to be the most common obstetric complication.

The successful isolation of live Lleida bat lyssavirus from the carcass of the original bat and in vitro characterization of this novel lyssavirus are described here. In addition, the ability of a human rabies vaccine to confer protective immunity following challenge with this divergent lyssavirus was assessed. Two different doses of Lleida bat lyssavirus were used to challenge vaccinated or naïve mice: a high dose of 100 focus-forming units (f.f.u.) 30 µl and a 100-fold dilution of this dose, 1 f.f.u. 30 µl. Although all naïve control mice succumbed to the 100 f.f.u. 30 µl challenge, 42 % (n=5/12) of those infected intracerebrally with 1 f.f.u. 30 µl survived the challenge.

Using artificial intelligence applied to text mining, this study analyzed the genes involved in the pathogenesis, development, and progression of endometriosis. The data extraction by text mining of the endometriosis-related genes in the PubMed database was based on natural language processing, and the data were filtered to remove false positives. Using data from the text mining and gene network information as input for the web-based tool, 15,207 endometriosis-related genes were ranked according to their score in the database. Characterization of the filtered gene set through gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis provided information about the numerous mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible for the establishment of ectopic endometrial tissue, as well as the migration, implantation, survival, and proliferation of ectopic endometrial cells. Finally, the human genome was scanned through various databases using filtered genes as a seed to determine novel genes that might also be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis but which have not yet been characterized.

Treatment was delivered in two sessions, first for the seemingly only active right ovary, and at a later stage for the left ovary. Some logistical problems were encountered during the preparation of the first treatment, which were subsequently optimized for the second treatment by using transvaginal ultrasound to determine the optimum time point for simulation and delivery. Using breath-hold gated delivery and plan adaptation, radiation dose to the bowel could be minimized, resulting in good tolerance of treatment. Because of the need to simulate and deliver in a brief optimal time span for visibility of the follicles in the ovaries, a single fraction dose of 8 Gy was used in our patient. Hormonal outcome after her second treatment is still pending. In conclusion, MRgRT with plan adaptation is feasible for the occasional patient with refractory endometriosis. Simulation and delivery needs to be synchronized with the menstrual cycle, ensuring that the Graafian follicles allow the ovaries to be visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because the ovaries are only visible on T2-weighted MRI for a very brief period of time, we suggest that it is preferable to use single fraction radiotherapy with a brief interval between simulation imaging and delivery.','2018-03-09 00:00:00','2018-03-09 00:00:00','2018-05-11 00:00:00',0,0,'Tetar, Shyama, S|Bruynzeel, Anna, A|Bohoudi, Omar, O|Nieboer, Theodoor, T|Lagerwaard, Frank, F','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(263,27,29746036,'0390-6663','Deep infiltrating endometriosis in young women.','This work aimed to analyze the effect of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) in young women.

Spontaneous pregnancy occurred soon after LNG-IUS removal in 2011. In the 33rd week of pregnancy, the patient started to feel severe abdominal pain. No fever or sings of pelviperitonitis were present, but as the pain worsened, a cesarean section was performed, with the delivery of a premature healthy male, and an intestinal rupture was identified. Severe peritoneal infection and sepsis ensued. A colostomy was performed, and the patient recovered after eight days in intensive care. Three months later, the colostomy was closed, and a new LNG-IUS was inserted. The patient then came to be treated by our multidisciplinary endometriosis team. The diagnostic evaluation revealed the presence of intestinal lesions with extrinsic compression of the rectum. She then underwent a laparoscopic excision of the endometriotic lesions, including an ovarian endometrioma, adhesiolysis and segmental colectomy in 2014. She is now fully recovered and planning a new pregnancy. A transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) performed six months after surgery showed signs of pelvic adhesions, but no endometriotic lesions.','2018-04-01 00:00:00','2018-05-10 00:00:00','2018-05-10 00:00:00',0,0,'Carneiro, Márcia Mendonça, MM|Costa, Luciana Maria Pyramo, LMP|Torres, Maria Das Graças, MDG|Gouvea, Patrícia Salomé, PS|Ávila, Ivete de, I','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(265,27,29744578,'1432-1262','Outcomes after rectosigmoid resection for endometriosis: a systematic literature review.','\"Endometriosis\" is defined such as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity.

Although it was first described in 1860, its etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. It is now accepted that inflammation plays a central role in the development and progression of endometriosis. In particular, it is marked by an inflammatory process associated with the overproduction of an array of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, metalloproteinases, cytokines, and chemokines. In addition, the growth and adhesion of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals lead to disease onset, its ensuing symptoms-among which pain and infertility.

Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.','Tubal pathology is a causative factor in 20% of subfertile couples. Traditionally, tubal testing during fertility work-up is performed by hysterosalpingography (HSG). Hysterosalpingo-foam sonography (HyFoSy) is a new technique that is thought to have comparable accuracy as HSG, while it is less expensive and more patient friendly. HyFoSy would be an acceptable alternative for HSG, provided it has similar effectiveness in terms of patient outcomes.We aim to compare the effectiveness and costs of management guided by HyFoSy or by HSG. Consenting women will undergo tubal testing by both HyFoSy and HSG in a randomized order during fertility work-up. The study group will consist of 1163 subfertile women between 18 and 41 years old who are scheduled for tubal patency testing during their fertility work-up. Women with anovulatory cycles not responding to ovulation induction, endometriosis, severe male subfertility or a known contrast (iodine) allergy will be excluded. We anticipate that 7 % (N = 82) of the participants will have discordant test results for HyFoSy and HSG. These participants will be randomly allocated to either a management strategy based on HyFoSy or a management strategy based on HSG, resulting in either a diagnostic laparoscopy with chromopertubation or a strategy that assumes tubal patency (intrauterine insemination or expectant management). The primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy leading to live birth within 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes are patient pain scores, time to pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage rate, multiple pregnancy rate, preterm birth rate and number of additional treatments. Costs will be estimated by counting resource use and calculating unit prices.This trial will compare the effectiveness and costs of HyFoSy versus HSG in assessing tubal patency in subfertile women.Dutch Trial Register (NTR 4746, http://www.trialregister.nl ).

Gynecologic cancers were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The outcome measure was the standardized incidence ratio (95% CI) calculated as the ratio between the observed to the expected number of cancers and defined for each gynecologic cancer and further stratified according to the histology, follow-up time since surgery, and age at follow-up. The follow-up was 838,685 person-years, and the Finnish female population served as the reference.Endometriosis was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio 1.76 [95% CI 1.47-2.08]), especially with endometrioid (3.12 [2.15-4.38]) and clear cell (5.17 [3.20-7.89]) histologic type and to a lesser extent with serous type (1.37 [1.02-1.80]). The risk of ovarian cancer was highest among women with ovarian endometriosis and especially for endometrioid (4.72 [2.75-7.56]) and clear cell (10.1 [5.50-16.9]) ovarian cancer, occurring 5-10 years after the index surgery. The overall risk of ovarian cancer was not increased among women with peritoneal and deep infiltrating endometriosis. However, peritoneal endometriosis was associated with a twofold increase in risk of endometrioid histology. The risk of endometrial cancer was not altered in the entire cohort. The standardized incidence ratio for precancerous cervical lesions was 0.81 (0.71-0.92) and for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical cancer 0.46 (0.20-0.91).The excess risk of ovarian cancer among women with ovarian endometriosis translates into two excess cases per 1,000 patients followed for 10 years.

Alterations in miRNA signatures have been reported in several neurodegenerative dementias, but data in prion diseases are restricted to ex vivo and animal models. The present study identified significant miRNA expression pattern alterations in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) patients. These changes display a highly regional and disease subtype-dependent regulation that correlates with brain pathology. We demonstrate that selected miRNAs are enriched in sCJD isolated Argonaute(Ago)-binding complexes in disease, indicating their incorporation into RNA-induced silencing complexes, and further suggesting their contribution to disease-associated gene expression changes. Alterations in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory machinery and perturbed levels of miRNA biogenesis key components in sCJD brain samples reported here further implicate miRNAs in sCJD gene expression (de)regulation. We also show that a subset of sCJD-altered miRNAs are commonly changed in Alzheimer\'s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and fatal familial insomnia, suggesting potential common mechanisms underlying these neurodegenerative processes. Additionally, we report no correlation between brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) miRNA-profiles in sCJD, indicating that CSF-miRNA profiles do not faithfully mirror miRNA alterations detected in brain tissue of human prion diseases. Finally, utilizing a sCJD MM1 mouse model, we analyzed the miRNA deregulation patterns observed in sCJD in a temporal manner. While fourteen sCJD-related miRNAs were validated at clinical stages, only two of those were changed at early symptomatic phase, suggesting that the miRNAs altered in sCJD may contribute to later pathogenic processes.

CGG repeats were reported to be able to form secondary structures, such as hairpins, . When such secondary structures are formed, repeats can lead to replication fork stalling even in the absence of any additional perturbation. Indeed, it was recently shown that the replication forks stall at the endogenous  locus in unaffected and FXS cells, suggesting the formation of secondary repeat structures at the  gene . If not dealt with properly replication fork stalling can lead to polymerase slippage and repeat expansion as well as fragile site expression. Despite the presence of repeat structures at the  locus, chromosomal fragility is only expressed under replicative stress suggesting the existence of potential molecular mechanisms that help the replication fork progress through these repeat regions. DNA helicases are known to aid replication forks progress through repetitive DNA sequences. Yet, the identity of the DNA helicase(s) responsible for unwinding the CGG repeats at  locus is not known. We found that the human DNA helicase B (HDHB) may provide an answer for this question. We used chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay to study the  region and common fragile sites (CFS), and asked whether HDHB localizes at replication forks stalled at repetitive regions even in unperturbed cells. HDHB was strongly enriched in S-phase at the repetitive DNA at CFS and  gene but not in the flanking regions.

In the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS, the maturation of synapses and circuits during critical period (CP) development in the somatosensory cortex is delayed, but it is unclear how this contributes to altered tactile sensory processing in the mature CNS. Here we demonstrate that inhibiting the juvenile chloride co-transporter NKCC1, which contributes to altered chloride homeostasis in developing cortical neurons of FXS mice, rectifies the chloride imbalance in layer IV somatosensory cortex neurons and corrects the development of thalamocortical excitatory synapses during the CP. Comparison of protein abundances demonstrated that NKCC1 inhibition during early development caused a broad remodeling of the proteome in the barrel cortex. In addition, the abnormally large size of whisker-evoked cortical maps in adult Fmr1 knockout mice was corrected by rectifying the chloride imbalance during the early CP. These data demonstrate that correcting the disrupted driving force through GABA receptors during the CP in cortical neurons restores their synaptic development, has an unexpectedly large effect on differentially expressed proteins, and produces a long-lasting correction of somatosensory circuit function in FXS mice.','2018-04-27 00:00:00','2018-04-27 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00',0,0,'He, Qionger, Q|Arroyo, Erica D, ED|Smukowski, Samuel N, SN|Xu, Jian, J|Piochon, Claire, C|Savas, Jeffrey N, JN|Portera-Cailliau, Carlos, C|Contractor, Anis, A','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(304,31,29693293,'1365-2788','Examining the influence of social-environmental variables on self-injurious behaviour in adolescent boys with fragile X syndrome.','Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common known inherited form of intellectual disability, are at increased risk for showing specific forms of self-injurious behaviour (SIB) such as hand biting and head hitting, suggesting that biological factors associated with the syndrome confers increased risk for SIB.

We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify the extent to which storage temperature and clinical specimen type influence Ebola virus viability. Virus infectivity was determined using a fluorescent focus-forming assay. In our study, we show that Ebola virus was the most stable in EDTA-whole blood and plasma samples, whereas rapid decay of infectivity was observed in simulated capillary blood, urine and semen samples, especially when these samples were stored at higher temperatures. The analysis of variance results demonstrated that both temperature and clinical specimen type have significant effects on virus viability, whereas donor differences were not observed. Repeated freeze and thaw cycles of the samples also had a notable impact on virus viability in EDTA-whole blood and urine.

However, mAbs that exhibit neutralization or protective properties against multiple filoviruses are rare. Here we examined a panel of engineered bi- and trispecific antibodies, in which variable domains of mAbs that target epitopes from multiple filoviruses were combined, for their capacity to neutralize viral infection across filovirus species. We found that bispecific combinations targeting EBOV and Sudan virus (another ebolavirus), provide potent cross-neutralization and protection in mice.

A good prophylactic vaccine should be able to provide protection to all known filovirus species and as an upside potentially protect from newly emerging virus strains. We investigated the immunogenicity and protection elicited by multivalent vaccines expressing glycoproteins (GP) from Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV) and Marburg virus (MARV). Immune responses against filovirus GP have been associated with protection from disease. The GP antigens were expressed by adenovirus serotypes 26 and 35 (Ad26 and Ad35) and modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors, all selected for their strong immunogenicity and good safety profile. Using fully lethal NHP intramuscular challenge models, we assessed different vaccination regimens for immunogenicity and protection from filovirus disease. Heterologous multivalent Ad26-Ad35 prime-boost vaccination regimens could give full protection against MARV (range 75%-100% protection) and EBOV (range 50% to 100%) challenge, and partial protection (75%) against SUDV challenge. Heterologous multivalent Ad26-MVA prime-boost immunization gave full protection against EBOV challenge in a small cohort study. The use of such multivalent vaccines did not show overt immune interference in comparison with monovalent vaccines. Multivalent vaccines induced GP-specific antibody responses and cellular IFNγ responses to each GP expressed by the vaccine, and cross-reactivity to TAFV GP was detected in a trivalent vaccine expressing GP from EBOV, SUDV and MARV. In the EBOV challenge studies, higher humoral EBOV GP-specific immune responses (p = 0.0004) were associated with survival from EBOV challenge and less so for cellular immune responses (p = 0.0320).

The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.','2018-03-15 00:00:00','2018-02-15 00:00:00','2018-04-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Banerjee, Arinjay, A|Misra, Vikram, V|Schountz, Tony, T|Baker, Michelle L, ML','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(334,34,29401664,'1999-4915','A Simple Mechanism Based on Amino Acid Substitutions is not a Critical Determinant of High Mortality of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection in Mice.','For the development of effective treatment strategies for Japanese encephalitis (JE), it is important to identify the viral factors causing severe disease during JE virus (JEV) infection. In this study, we assessed whether amino acid substitutions are critical factors for higher mortality of JaTH160 compared with JaOArS982 in mice using the technique of infectious cDNA clones. We raised the possibility that two amino acids of C and NS3 of JaTH160 may contribute to increased mortality in mice. However, simultaneous substitutions of these amino acids did not significantly increase the virulence of JaOArS982, suggesting that high mortality due to JaTH160 viral infection cannot be simply attributed to the specific amino acids.

MFS and WT (wild-type) 1-month-old mice were allocated to 3 groups: untreated, treated with losartan, and treated with lipoic acid. At 6 months old, echocardiography, ROS production, and morphological analysis of aortas were performed. Aortic ROS generation in 6-month-old MFS animals was higher at advanced stages of disease in MFS. An unprecedented finding in MFS mice analyzed by OCT was the occurrence of focal inhomogeneous regions in the aortic arch, either collagen-rich extremely thickened or collagen-poor hypotrophic regions. MFS animals treated with lipoic acid showed markedly reduced ROS production and lower ERK1/2 phosphorylation; meanwhile, aortic dilation and elastic fiber breakdown were unaltered. Of note, lipoic acid treatment associated with the absence of focal inhomogeneous regions in MFS animals. Losartan reduced aortic dilation and elastic fiber breakdown despite no change in ROS generation. In conclusion, oxidant generation by itself seems neutral with respect to aneurysm progression in MFS; however, lipoic acid-mediated reduction of inhomogeneous regions may potentially associate with less anisotropy and reduced chance of dissection/rupture.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Guido, Maria C, MC|Debbas, Victor, V|Salemi, Vera M, VM|Tavares, Elaine R, ER|Meirelles, Thayna, T|Araujo, Thaís L S, TLS|Nolasco, Patricia, P|Ferreira-Filho, Julio C A, JCA|Takimura, Celso K, CK|Pereira, Lygia V, LV|Laurindo, Francisco R, FR','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(337,35,29758081,'1932-6203','Correction: Sex, pregnancy and aortic disease in Marfan syndrome.','[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0181166.].','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-05-14 00:00:00','2018-05-14 00:00:00',0,0,'Renard, Marjolijn, M|Muiño-Mosquera, Laura, L|Manalo, Elise C, EC|Tufa, Sara, S|Carlson, Eric J, EJ|Keene, Douglas R, DR|Backer, Julie De, J|Sakai, Lynn Y, LY','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(338,35,29749581,'1092-8464','Preconception Counseling for Patients With Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms.','Acute aortic dissection is a potentially catastrophic cardiovascular emergency that is associated with a high mortality rate.

Since monitoring of patients, preventive medical and surgical treatments are available nowadays, other MFS pathologies are becoming more relevant for the outcome of the disease. Main pulmonary artery (MPA) dilatation is a cardiac finding, which has not been fully investigated in children. Due to the similarities in tissue composition of the aortic and pulmonary root, MPA dilatation may cause complications and require treatment. In addition, it may be a predictor for severe connective tissue involvement. We retrospectively examined 135 pediatric patients with MFS. 8.1% showed MPA dilatation. MPA dilatation was associated with earlier occurrence of aortic dilatation, mitral valve prolapse, and systemic manifestations of MFS compared with patients without MPA dilatation (p < 0.05). The presence of MPA dilatation was also associated with a higher incidence of ectopia lentis (p < 0.05). Medical treatment was started earlier in MPA dilatation patients than in those without (p < 0.05). We conclude that MPA dilatation is a sign of more severe vascular and connective tissue involvement. Regular examination of the pulmonary artery is essential in MFS to avoid complications. As medical treatment of life threatening MFS events has improved, other features of MFS need to be investigated to improve quality of life.','2018-04-25 00:00:00','2018-04-25 00:00:00','2018-04-26 00:00:00',0,0,'Stark, Veronika C, VC|Huemmer, Michael, M|Olfe, Jakob, J|Mueller, Goetz C, GC|Kozlik-Feldmann, Rainer, R|Mir, Thomas S, TS','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(343,35,29688450,'1569-9285','Morphological features of the thoracic aorta and supra-aortic branches in patients with acute Type A aortic dissection in China.','This study aimed to investigate the morphological characteristics of the dissected thoracic aorta and brachiocephalic arteries within the Chinese population.A retrospective analysis of computed tomography scans of 387 patients with acute Type A aortic dissection was carried out.

Calculated stiffness indices including pulse wave velocity (PWV), distensibility and relative area change (RAC) were collected to characterize the ascending aorta and descending aorta. PWV was also determined to evaluate global aortic arch stiffness.Patients with TS had reduced distensibility (0.43 vs 0.58%/mmHg, P < 0.05) and RAC (21 vs 29%, P < 0.01) in the ascending aorta when compared with normal controls. Similarly, patients with MFS had reduced ascending aortic distensibility (0.39 vs 0.58%/mmHg, P < 0.05) and RAC (22 vs 29%, P < 0.05). There were no differences in measured PWV in the ascending aorta. Patients with TS had significantly elevated PWV measured in the aortic arch when compared with controls (2.7 vs 1.9 m/s, P < 0.05). Patients with MFS had more prominent elevation in aortic arch PWV (4.2 vs 1.9 m/s, P < 0.01).

Additionally, 18 TS patients with a BAV were compared with 19 TS patients with a trileaflet aortic valve, without significant differences observed in any of the considered stiffness indices.TS and MFS teenage patients display evidence of increased aortic stiffness.

A longitudinal cohort study design was used with a representative random population-based sample in Stockholm, Sweden. Registry-based health record data on all specialized outpatient health care visits and prescription drug use was linked to a sample of 1154 sexual minority individuals from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort and their siblings.

Severe psychological trauma and prolonged distress may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Together, symptoms of derealization and, related specifically to the sense of body ownership and agency, of depersonalization (where parts of the body or the entire body itself is perceived as detached and out of control), constitute the dissociative subtype (PTSD+DS). In this study, we explored the Rubber Hand Illusion, an experimental paradigm utilized to manipulate sense of body ownership in PTSD ( = 4) and PTSD+DS ( = 6) as compared to healthy controls ( = 7). Perceived finger location and self-report questionnaires were used as behavioral and subjective measures of the illusion, respectively. In addition, the correlation between the illusion\'s effect and sense of agency as a continuous feeling of controlling one\'s own body movements was explored. Here, a lower illusion effect was observed in the PTSD as compared to the control group after synchronous stimulation for both the proprioceptive drift and subjectively perceived illusion. Moreover, by both proprioceptive drift and by subjective ratings, the PTSD+DS group showed a response characterized by high variance, ranging from a very strong to a very weak effect of the illusion. Finally, sense of agency showed a trend toward a negative correlation with the strength of the illusion as subjectively perceived by participants with PTSD and PTSD+DS. These findings suggest individuals with PTSD may, at times, maintain a rigid representation of the body as an avoidance strategy, with top-down cognitive processes weakening the impact of manipulation of body ownership. By contrast, the response elicited in PTSD+DS appeared to be driven by either an increased vulnerability to manipulation of embodiment or by a dominant top-down cognitive representation of the body, with disruption of multisensory integration processes likely in both cases. Taken together, these findings further our understanding of bodily consciousness in PTSD and its dissociative subtype and highlight the supportive role played by sense of agency for the maintenance of body ownership.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-05-01 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Rabellino, Daniela, D|Burin, Dalila, D|Harricharan, Sherain, S|Lloyd, Chantelle, C|Frewen, Paul A, PA|McKinnon, Margaret C, MC|Lanius, Ruth A, RA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(350,36,29764602,'1879-1360','Psychiatric disorders among people living with HIV/AIDS in IRAN: Prevalence, severity, service utilization and unmet mental health needs.','HIV and psychiatric disorders are closely correlated and are accompanied by some similar risk factors.The aim of this study was to assess psychiatric comorbidity and health service utilization for mental problems among people living with HIV/AIDS in Iran.A total of 250 cases were randomly selected from a large referral center for HIV treatment and care in Tehran, Iran.

The aim of the study was to assess the psychological impact of VHL genetic testing in patients previously diagnosed with a CNS HB. From 1999 until 2015, 55 patients underwent surgery for CNS HBs. Eleven patients were already screened for VHL mutations and 3 patients deceased before the start of the study. From the remaining 42 patients, 24 were accepted to be enrolled in the study. Assessment of psychological impact of VHL genetic testing was performed by measuring anxiety levels, mood disorders, quality of life, and psychological consequences of genetic screening. Twenty-one of the enrolled 24 patients underwent VHL genetic testing and 12 patients came back for the communication of positive genetic results. The baseline psychological status did not differ between these 2 groups. Patients who attended the visit of communication of genetic results had similar anxiety levels compared to those who had not. Furthermore, they also experienced an improvement in the level of anxiety and two QoL dimension scores compared to their baseline status.

We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies.

All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of \"self\" antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation.

Here, we examine the role of MRTFA in the development of adipose tissue fibrosis and identify a signaling pathway that regulates the fate of vascular progenitors. We demonstrate that obesity induces the formation of Sca1, Sma, ITGA5 fibrogenic progenitor cells (FPCs) in adipose tissue. MRTFA deficiency in mice shifts the fate of perivascular progenitors from FPCs to adipocyte precursor cells and protects against chronic obesity-induced fibrosis and accompanying metabolic dysfunction, without a shift in energy expenditure. Our findings highlight the ITGA5-MRTFA pathway as a potential target to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disease.','2018-05-15 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Lin, Jean Z, JZ|Rabhi, Nabil, N|Farmer, Stephen R, SR','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(365,38,29768343,'1536-5964','Potential common factors associated with predisposition to common cold in middle-aged and elderly Japanese: A community-based cross-sectional study.','People worldwide frequently catch a common cold, which occasionally develops into secondary severe conditions such as pneumonia. However, it is unclear whether predisposition to the common cold is associated with the individual\'s characteristics including age, body weight, lifestyles, diets, and intestinal functions, besides exposure to a responsible pathogen. We addressed this issue epidemiologically considering many relevant clinical factors.We reviewed data from a cross-sectional study consisting of 39,524 apparently healthy Japanese aged 40 to 79 years (26,975 men and 12,549 women) who underwent a checkup in 2007. Self-reported predisposition to common cold (SPCC) and relevant clinical conditions and parameters were considered.We observed no significant difference in most clinical parameters including age, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and prevalence of men and current smokers between subjects with and without SPCC. In univariate analysis, circulating white blood cell (WBC) count and serum alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) were significantly higher in subjects with SPCC than in those without, whereas serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and duration of sleep were lower. In logistic regression analysis after full adjustment for relevant confounding factors, BMI categories except BMI of ≥27.0 kg/m were significantly associated with SPCC compared with BMI of 23.0 to 24.9 kg/m. Short duration of sleep (≤5 hours), occasional alcohol drinking, and no-exercise were significantly associated with SPCC compared with 7 hours sleep duration, no-drinking alcohol, and low frequent exercise (twice per month), respectively. All gastrointestinal disorders (gastric complaints, constipation, and diarrhea) were independently associated with SPCC. Imbalanced diet and taking a snack were also associated with SPCC in a degree dependent manner. Furthermore, WBC count, serum ALT, and HDL-C (as continuous variables) were associated with SPCC (HDL-C was inversely), whereas no significant association was observed between SPCC and age, smoking, HbA1c, and pharmacotherapy for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.Our results demonstrated that multifactorial conditions and parameters might be simultaneously associated with the predisposition to common cold.

We used Fourier regression to examine seasonal trends in disease and calculated the peak-to-nadir ratio for each infectious condition.Over 20% of pediatric visits during the study period were for infectious conditions. Upper respiratory infection, otitis media, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, cellulitis/abscess, and pneumonia showed a seasonal pattern that matched trends found in prior regional or microbiologic-based studies. The strongest seasonal trend as measured by goodness of model fit was found in pneumonia (peak-to-nadir incidence ratio of 2.7), followed by otitis media (2.0), cellulitis/abscess (2.0), gastroenteritis (1.6), upper respiratory infection (3.2), and urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis (1.4). Pharyngitis did not show a strong seasonal trend.Many of the most common pediatric infectious diseases diagnosed in US EDs exhibited seasonal patterns.

To establish the cell model of acute pneumonia, A549 cells were treated with 1 mg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The effects of miR-1247 dysregulation on the cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation and autophagy of LPS-induced A549 cells were investigated. Moreover, the functional targets of miR-1247 were identified and the regulatory relationships between miR-1247 and JNK or NF-κB pathways were explored.The miR-1247 was lowly expressed in acute phage patients with infantile pneumonia. In addition, LPS treatment significantly inhibited A549cell viability, induced apoptosis, promoted the production of cytokines and decreased autophagy, thus causing A549 cell injury. Moreover, miR-1247 was decreased expression after LPS treatment, and overexpression of miR-1247 alleviated LPS-induced A549 cell injury. Furthermore, CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 16 was a functional target gene of miR-1247.

The outcome of lower respiratory infection is determined by the degrees to which immunity is protective and inflammation is damaging. Intercellular and interorgan signaling networks coordinate these actions to fight infection and protect the tissue. Cells residing in the lung initiate and steer these responses, with additional immunity effectors recruited from the bloodstream. Responses of extrapulmonary tissues, including the liver, bone marrow, and others, are essential to resistance and resilience. Responses in the lung and extrapulmonary organs can also be counterproductive and drive acute and chronic comorbidities after respiratory infection. This review discusses cell-specific and organ-specific roles in the integrated physiological response to acute lung infection, and the mechanisms by which intercellular and interorgan signaling contribute to host defense and healthy respiratory physiology or to acute lung injury, chronic pulmonary disease, and adverse extrapulmonary sequelae.

Primary outcomes included confirmed pneumonia within 3 months post stroke and length of acute inpatient stay. Secondary outcomes related to the feasibility of implementing a CRT pathway and clinician and patient satisfaction. There was a non-significant reduction in pneumonia rates by 2.2% points in the CRT group (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.06-1.62). There was a non-significant difference of 0.7 days (95% CI - 0.29 to 1.71 days) in length of stay between the standard care group and the CRT group.

High patient and clinician satisfaction with CRT was found, with clinicians reporting additional knowledge and confidence in decision making for dysphagia management. Post hoc subgroup analyses according to stroke types were conducted and revealed no significant differences in pneumonia rates after adjustment for multiple comparisons. In conclusion, it was possible to implement a CRT pathway with minimal increases in clinician resources.

How PCOS is passed on from one generation to the next is not clear, but it may be a developmental condition. Most women with PCOS exhibit higher levels of circulating luteinizing hormone, suggestive of heightened gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as compared to healthy women. Excess AMH in utero may affect the development of the female fetus. However, as AMH levels drop during pregnancy in women with normal fertility, it was unclear whether their levels were also elevated in pregnant women with PCOS. Here we measured AMH in a cohort of pregnant women with PCOS and control pregnant women and found that AMH is significantly more elevated in the former group versus the latter. To determine whether the elevation of AMH during pregnancy in women with PCOS is a bystander effect or a driver of the condition in the offspring, we modeled our clinical findings by treating pregnant mice with AMH and followed the neuroendocrine phenotype of their female progeny postnatally. This treatment resulted in maternal neuroendocrine-driven testosterone excess and diminished placental metabolism of testosterone to estradiol, resulting in a masculinization of the exposed female fetus and a PCOS-like reproductive and neuroendocrine phenotype in adulthood. We found that the affected females had persistently hyperactivated GnRH neurons and that GnRH antagonist treatment in the adult female offspring restored their neuroendocrine phenotype to a normal state. These findings highlight a critical role for excess prenatal AMH exposure and subsequent aberrant GnRH receptor signaling in the neuroendocrine dysfunctions of PCOS, while offering a new potential therapeutic avenue to treat the condition during adulthood.','2018-05-14 00:00:00','2018-05-14 00:00:00','2018-05-15 00:00:00',0,0,'Tata, Brooke, B|Mimouni, Nour El Houda, NEH|Barbotin, Anne-Laure, AL|Malone, Samuel A, SA|Loyens, Anne, A|Pigny, Pascal, P|Dewailly, Didier, D|Catteau-Jonard, Sophie, S|Sundström-Poromaa, Inger, I|Piltonen, Terhi T, TT|Dal Bello, Federica, F|Medana, Claudio, C|Prevot, Vincent, V|Clasadonte, Jerome, J|Giacobini, Paolo, P','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(380,39,29760297,'1674-8301','Follicular hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome patients with normal circulating testosterone levels.','Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disease with high heterogeneity. The role of excess androgen in PCOS etiology remains disputed, since around 20%-50% of PCOS women do not display hyperandrogenemia. The microenvironment of the ovary critically influences follicular development. In the present study, we assessed the role of androgen in PCOS by investigating whether excessive follicular fluid androgen was present in PCOS patients with normal serum androgen levels and influenced by follicular fluid insulin resistance (IR). Follicular fluid samples of 105 women with PCOS and 105 controls were collected. Levels of steroid hormones, glucose and insulin in the follicular fluid were examined and compared with data from serum biochemistry tests. We found that 64.9% (63/97) of PCOS patients with normal serum androgen levels displayed abnormally high follicular fluid androgen level. The follicular fluid androgen level was positively correlated with follicular fluid IR within a certain range and follicular fluid estrogen-to-testosterone (E2/T) ratio was significantly reduced in these patients. These results indicated that there existed a subgroup of PCOS patients who displayed excessive follicular fluid androgen and IR despite their normal circulating testosterone (T) levels.

We used the Rotterdam Criteria for all patients and transvaginal sonography was performed.The mean age of patients was 27.75±6.22 and the mean body mass index was 32.69±0.94 kg/m2. Comparing with baseline, treatment with orlistat resulted in a significant reduction in weight, BMI, and waist circumference (p=0.001). We also found a remarkable reduction in total testosterone levels (p>0.001). Treatment improved the sex hormone-binding globulin plasma levels, but the improvement was not statistically significant. There was no reduction in other androgen levels.This study showed a significant reduction of weight and total testosterone level - the most important androgen in polycystic ovary syndrome - after 12 weeks of treatment with orlistat.

The pathway can regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival by activating ribosomal kinases. Recent studies have implicated the mTOR signaling pathway in ovarian neoplasms, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF). Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in the control of various ovarian functions. mTOR allows cancer cells to escape the normal biochemical system and regulates the balance between apoptosis and survival. Some recent studies have suggested that involvement of the mTOR signaling system is an important pathophysiological basis of PCOS. Overexpression of the mTOR pathway can impair the interaction of cumulus cells, lead to insulin resistance, and affect the growth of follicles directly. The roles of mTOR signaling in follicular development have been extensively studied in recent years; abnormalities in this process lead to a series of pathologies such as POF and infertility. To improve understanding of the role of the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and development of ovarian diseases, here we review the roles of mTOR signaling in such diseases and discuss the corresponding therapeutic strategies that target this pathway.

Years of research provided plenty of information on the molecular genetics of these disorders and the obesity phenotype leading to a more individualized treatment of the symptoms, however, a lot of questions still remain unanswered. As these obesity syndromes have different signs and symptoms in common, it makes it difficult to accurately diagnose patients which may result in inappropriate treatment of the disease. Therefore, the big challenge for clinicians and scientists is to more clearly differentiate all syndromic forms of obesity to provide conclusive genetic explanations and eventually deliver accurate genetic counseling and treatment.

Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was -3.7% (-15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; P = 1.0).

There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms.To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions.Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods.We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score -5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to -4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale -0.50, 95% CI -3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD -6.05, 95% CI -7.87 to -4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short-term follow-up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH-CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short-term follow-up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.69 to -0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life.4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short-term follow-up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -6.18, 95% CI -7.46 to -4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium-term follow-up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short-term follow-up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -3.82 to -1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery.Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient-important outcomes including potential treatment-related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-12 00:00:00','2018-05-14 00:00:00',0,0,'Franco, Juan Va, JV|Turk, Tarek, T|Jung, Jae Hung, JH|Xiao, Yu-Tian, YT|Iakhno, Stanislav, S|Garrote, Virginia, V|Vietto, Valeria, V','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(398,41,29751604,'1420-3049','Graminex Pollen: Phenolic Pattern, Colorimetric Analysis and Protective Effects in Immortalized Prostate Cells (PC3) and Rat Prostate Challenged with LPS.','Prostatitis, a general term describing prostate inflammation, is a common disease that could be sustained by bacterial or non-bacterial infectious agents.

Pollen extracts have been previously reported as promising agents in managing clinical symptoms related to prostatitis. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the protective effects of Graminex pollen (Graminex, Deshler, OH, USA), a commercially available product based on standardized pollen extracts, in rat prostate specimens, ex vivo. In this context, we studied the putative mechanism of action of pollen on multiple inflammatory pathways, including the reduction of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF&kappa;B), and malondialdehyde (MDA), whose activities were significantly increased by inflammatory stimuli. We characterized by means of chromatographic and colorimetric studies the composition of Graminex pollen to better correlate the activity of pollen on immortalized prostate cells (PC3), and in rat prostate specimens challenged with  lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that Graminex pollen was able to reduce radical oxygen species (ROS) production by PC3 cells and MDA, NF&kappa;B mRNA, and PGE₂ levels, in rat prostate specimens.

Despite the tight association between both processes, the phenomenon has recently been termed inflammageing. Inflammation in the male reproductive tract is frequently linked with bacterial or virus infections but also with a broad range of noninfectious processes. Prostatitis, epididymitis and orchitis, among others, can lead to infertility. However, in spite of the inflammation theory of disease, chronic inflammation in male urogenital system does not always cause symptoms. With advancing age, inflammatory processes are commonly observed in the male reproductive tract. Nevertheless, the incidence of inflammation in reproductive organs and ducts varies greatly among elderly men. Inflammageing is considered a predictor of pathogenesis and the development of age-related diseases. This article briefly summarises the current state of knowledge on inflammageing in the male reproductive tract. Yet, the precise aetiology of inflammageing in the male urogenital system, and its potential contribution not only to infertility but most importantly to adverse health outcomes remains almost unknown.

We also collated evidence for other putative drivers of C. burnetii geographical dispersal.In all documented outbreaks, infective sheep or goats, not cattle, was the likely source. Evidence suggests a prominent role of airborne dispersal; Coxiella burnetii travels up to 18 km on gale force winds. In rural areas, highest infection risk occurs within 5 km of sources. Urban outbreaks generally occur over smaller distances, though evidence on attack rate gradients is limited. Wind speed / direction, spreading of animal products, and stocking density may all contribute to C. burnetii environmental gradients.Q fever environmental gradients depend on urbanization level, ruminant species, stocking density and wind speed.

These effects make these drugs a possible option in the treatment of several tumors in association with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, the repurposing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently being examined for neurological diseases such as neurosarcoidosis, chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to corticosteroids, and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Several ongoing clinical trials have been testing these drugs in non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases.

A small proportion of patients (1%-5%) develop chronic Q fever, which is accompanied by high mortality and can be manifested as infected arterial or aortic aneurysms or infected vascular prostheses. The disease can be complicated by arterial fistulas, which are often fatal if they are left untreated. We aimed to assess the cumulative incidence of arterial fistulas and mortality in patients with proven chronic Q fever.In a retrospective, observational study, the cumulative incidence of arterial fistulas (aortoenteric, aortobronchial, aortovenous, or arteriocutaneous) in patients with proven chronic Q fever (according to the Dutch Chronic Q Fever Consensus Group criteria) was assessed. Proven chronic Q fever with a vascular focus of infection was defined as a confirmed mycotic aneurysm or infected prosthesis on imaging studies or positive result of serum polymerase chain reaction for C. burnetii in the presence of an arterial aneurysm or vascular prosthesis.Of 253 patients with proven chronic Q fever, 169 patients (67%) were diagnosed with a vascular focus of infection (42 of whom had a combined vascular focus and endocarditis). In total, 26 arterial fistulas were diagnosed in 25 patients (15% of patients with a vascular focus): aortoenteric (15), aortobronchial (2), aortocaval (4), and arteriocutaneous (5) fistulas (1 patient presented with both an aortocaval and an arteriocutaneous fistula). Chronic Q fever-related mortality was 60% for patients with and 21% for patients without arterial fistula (P < .0001). Primary fistulas accounted for 42% and secondary fistulas for 58%. Of patients who underwent surgical intervention for chronic Q fever-related fistula (n = 17), nine died of chronic Q fever-related causes (53%). Of patients who did not undergo any surgical intervention (n = 8), six died of chronic Q fever-related causes (75%).The proportion of patients with proven chronic Q fever developing primary or secondary arterial fistulas is high; 15% of patients with a vascular focus of infection develop an arterial fistula.

The objective of this study was to further understand predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors in the development and maintenance of insomnia in cancer survivors.A heterogeneous sample of 63 patients who had completed active treatment was recruited. Participants were required to have a score >7 on the Insomnia Severity Index and meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. Open-ended, semistructured interviews were conducted to elicit participants\' experiences with sleep problems. An a priori set of codes and a set of codes that emerged from the data were used to analyze the data.ResultThe mean age of the sample was 60.5 years, with 30% identifying as non-white and 59% reporting their sex as female. The cancer types represented were heterogeneous with the two most common being breast (30%) and prostate (21%). Participants described an inherited risk for insomnia, anxious temperament, and insufficient ability to relax as predisposing factors. Respondents were split as to whether they classified their cancer diagnosis as the precipitating factor for their insomnia. Participants reported several behaviors that are known to perpetuate problems with sleep including napping, using back-lit electronics before bed, and poor sleep hygiene. One of the most prominent themes identified was the use of sleeping medications. Participants reported that they were reluctant to take medication but felt that it was the only option to treat their insomnia and that it was encouraged by their doctors.Significance of resultsInsomnia is a prevalent, but highly treatable, disorder in cancer survivors.

Latent class analysis used maximum likelihood techniques to define the unobserved latent constructs that can be predicted as symptom clusters. Individual patients were assigned to the most probable class. Classes were compared on demographics, and logistic regression assessed the odds of individual items predicting each class.A four class model provided the best fit. Class 1 (n=829, 54.3%) was defined by the absence of distress; Classes 2, 3 and 4 all carried functional impairment.

Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines and \'Z\' drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments.To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015).

A third review author resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction.The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants).Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality evidence).There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence).Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency (mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27 minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants).There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence).\'Other\' antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence).There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased dry mouth and thirst).We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice) or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia.

The culprit drug had been discontinued. Systemic and topical glucocorticoids as well as supportive care had been instituted. The patient\'s outcome was favorable and his lesions had been recovered within the next weeks. Patient\'s follow-up showed that he had received ibuprofen again sometime later resulting in anal mucosal lesion and similar penile involvement. In routine clinical practice, mucocutaneous adverse drug reactions should be considered. A high index of suspicion, the detailed medication history, the course of the symptoms, and distributing pattern of the lesions are essential clues for the diagnosis. However, judicious and prompt pathological studies can help to differentiate multifocal bullous FDE from major skin drug reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.','2018-01-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-05-14 00:00:00',0,0,'Fazeli, Seyed Amirhossein, SA|Abbasi, Morteza, M|Jalali, Hadi, H|Eskandari, Sonia, S|Shamshirgaran, Farzaneh, F|Dehghani, Zahra, Z|Golabchifard, Reza, R|Ghiyasvand, Shahram, S|Ghannad, Kaveh, K','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(440,45,29743141,'1532-8171','Chemotherapy patient with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome presents to the Emergency Department: A case report.','Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is part of a continuum of severe mucocutaneous reactions, commonly thought to be triggered by certain medications.

A real-time, flow-sensitized pencil-beam MR imaging scan was used to measure CSF stroke volume during rest and immediately following coughing and relaxation periods (total scan time, 90 seconds). Multiple posterior fossa and craniocervical anatomic measurements were also obtained. Patients were classified into 2 groups by neurosurgeons blinded to MR imaging measurements: 1) nonspecific Chiari I malformation (5/13)-Chiari I malformation with nonspecific symptoms like non-cough-related or mild occasional cough-related headache, neck pain, dizziness, paresthesias, and/or trouble swallowing; 2) specific Chiari I malformation (8/13)-patients with Chiari I malformation with specific symptoms and/or objective findings like severe cough-related headache, myelopathy, syringomyelia, and muscle atrophy. The Spearman correlation was used to determine correlations between MR imaging measurements and disease severity, and both groups were also compared using a Mann-Whitney  test.There was a significant negative correlation between the percentage change in CSF stroke volume (resting to postcoughing) and Chiari I malformation disease severity ( = 0.59;  = .03). Mann-Whitney comparisons showed the percentage change in CSF stroke volume (resting to postcoughing) to be significantly different between patient groups ( = .04).

There are few studies on the national incidence of CM-1, taking into account outcomes based on concurrent diagnoses. To quantify trends in treatment and associated diagnoses, as retrospective review of the Kid\'s Inpatient Database (KID) from 2003-2012 was conducted.Patients aged 0-20 with primary diagnosis of CM-1 in the KID database were identified. Demographics and concurrent diagnoses were analyzed using chi-squared and -tests for categorical and numerical variables, respectively. Trends in diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).Five thousand four hundred and thirty-eight patients were identified in the KID database with a primary diagnosis of CM-1 (10.5 years, 55% female). CM-1 primary diagnoses have increased over time (45 to 96 per 100,000). CM-1 patients had the following concurrent diagnoses: 23.8% syringomyelia/syringobulbia, 11.5% scoliosis, 5.9% hydrocephalus, 2.2% tethered cord syndrome. Eighty-three point four percent of CM-1 patients underwent surgical treatment, and rate of surgical treatment for CM-1 increased from 2003-2012 (66% to 72%, P<0.001) though complication rate decreased (7% to 3%, P<0.001) and mortality rates remained constant. Seventy percent of surgeries involved decompression-only, which increased neurologic complications compared to fusions (P=0.039). Cranial decompressions decreased from 2003-2012 (42.2-30.5%) while spinal decompressions increased (73.1-77.4%). Fusion rates have increased over time (0.45% to 1.8%) and are associated with higher complications than decompression-only (11.9%  4.7%). Seven point four percent of patients experienced at least one peri-operative complication (nervous system, dysphagia, respiratory most common). Patients with concurrent hydrocephalus had increased; nervous system, respiratory and urinary complications (P<0.006) and syringomyelia increased the rate of respiratory complications (P=0.037).CM-1 diagnoses have increased in the last decade. Despite the decrease in overall complication rates, fusions are becoming more common and are associated with higher peri-operative complication rates.

The precise details concerning fluid outflow remain controversial. Although fluid dynamics have been studied in the brain, little is known about spinal cord fluid inflow and outflow. Understanding the normal fluid physiology of the spinal cord may give insight into the pathogenesis of spinal cord oedema and CSF disorders such as syringomyelia. We therefore aimed to determine the fluid outflow pathways in the rat spinal cord.A fluorescent tracer, Alexa-Fluor-647 Ovalbumin, was injected into the extracellular space of either the cervicothoracic lateral white matter or the grey matter in twenty-two Sprague-Dawley rats over 250 s. The rats were sacrificed at 20 or 60 min post injection. Spinal cord segments were sectioned and labelled with vascular antibodies for immunohistochemistry.Fluorescent tracer was distributed over two to three spinal levels adjacent to the injection site. In grey matter injections, tracer spread radially into the white matter. In white matter injections, tracer was confined to and redistributed along the longitudinal axonal fibres. Tracer was conducted towards the pial and ependymal surfaces along vascular structures. There was accumulation of tracer around the adventitia of the intramedullary arteries, veins and capillaries, as well as the extramedullary vessels. A distinct layer of tracer was deposited in the internal basement membrane of the tunica media of arteries. In half the grey matter injections, tracer was detected in the central canal.These results suggest that in the spinal cord interstitial fluid movement is modulated by tissue diffusivity of grey and white matter. The central canal, and the compartments around or within blood vessels appear to be dominant pathways for fluid drainage in these experiments. There may be regional variations in fluid outflow capacity due to vascular and other anatomical differences between the grey and white matter.','2018-04-29 00:00:00','2018-04-29 00:00:00','2018-05-03 00:00:00',0,0,'Liu, Shinuo, S|Lam, Magdalena A, MA|Sial, Alisha, A|Hemley, Sarah J, SJ|Bilston, Lynne E, LE|Stoodley, Marcus A, MA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(460,47,29701558,'1933-0715','Syringobulbia in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I.','OBJECTIVE Syringobulbia (SB) is a rare entity, with few cases associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) in the pediatric population. The authors reviewed all pediatric cases of CM-I-associated SB managed at their institution in order to better understand the presentation, treatment, and surgical outcomes of this condition. METHODS A prospectively maintained institutional database of craniovertebral junction abnormalities was analyzed to identify all cases of CM-I and SB from the MRI era (i.e., after 1984). The authors recorded presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, radiological findings, surgical treatment strategy, intraoperative findings, and outcomes. SB cases associated with tumors, infections, or type II Chiari malformations were excluded. RESULTS The authors identified 326 pediatric patients with CM-I who were surgically treated. SB was identified in 13 (4%) of these 326 patients. Headache and neck pain were noted in all 13 cases. Cranial nerve abnormalities were common: vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve dysfunction was the most frequent observation. Other cranial nerves affected included the trigeminal, abducens, and hypoglossal nerves. Several patients exhibited multiple cranial nerve palsies at presentation. Central sleep apnea was present in 6 patients. Syringomyelia (SM) was present in all 13 patients. SB involved the medulla in all cases, and extended rostrally into the pons and midbrain in 2 patients; in 1 of these 2 cases the cavity extended further rostrally to the cerebrum (syringocephaly). SB communicated with the fourth ventricle in 7 of the 13 cases. All 13 patients were treated with posterior fossa decompression with intradural exploration to ensure CSF egress out of the fourth ventricle and through the foramen magnum. The foramen of Magendie was found to be occluded by an arachnoid veil in 9 cases. Follow-up evaluation revealed that SB improved before SM. Cranial nerve palsies regressed in 11 of the 13 patients, and SB improved in all 13. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of SB in our surgical series of pediatric patients with CM-I was 4%, and all of these patients had accompanying SM. The SB cavity involved the medulla in all cases and was found to communicate with the fourth ventricle in 54% of cases. Posterior fossa decompression with intradural exploration and duraplasty is an effective treatment for these patients.','2018-04-27 00:00:00','2018-04-27 00:00:00','2018-04-27 00:00:00',0,0,'Menezes, Arnold H, AH|Greenlee, Jeremy D W, JDW|Dlouhy, Brian J, BJ','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(461,47,29698796,'1878-8769','Long-term Outcomes of a New Minimally Invasive Approach in Chiari Type 1 and 1.5 Malformations: Technical Note and Preliminary Results.','The treatment options for patients with Chiari malformation type-1(CM1) and Chiari malformation type-1.5(CM1.5) have not yet been standardized. In these malformations, the main factors include obstruction at the level of the foramen magnum, dural and ligamentous thickening. Here we have presented our outcomes of surgery and decompression using minimal invasive surgery(MIS) technique.Sixty-one patients admitted to our clinics between 2009 and 2016 due to CM1 or CM1.5, and who had undergone MIS, were investigated retrospectively. All patients were followed-up for a mean period of 55 months, both clinically and radiologically, and the outcomes were recorded.All patients underwent foramen magnum decompression through a 1.5 cm mini-open incision, C1 laminectomy and C2 medial inner side tour, posterior atlanto-occipital membrane removal, external dural delamination, and widening of the internal dura with longitudinal incisions. Fifty-six patients (91.8%) were satisfied, 4 (6.5%) remained the same, and 1 (1.6%) reported a poor outcome. Forty-five percent of those patients with syringomyelia demonstrated resolution within 2 years, and 92% demonstrated resolution in 5 years. Scoliosis was seen in 5 patients (8.1%). The benefit rate from the surgical procedure was statistically significant (p=0.0045), and none of the patients required additional surgery due to poor decompression.MIS is effective for non-complicated cases of CM1 and CM1.5 due to its minimal connective and muscular tissue damage, short surgical duration, short recovery time, early mobilization, effective posterior foramen magnum widening, lack of liquor fistula development, and better clinical and radiological improvement during the long-term follow-up.','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-04-23 00:00:00','2018-04-26 00:00:00',0,0,'Kotil, Kadir, K|Ozdogan, Selcuk, S|Kayaci, Selim, S|Duzkalir, Hanife Gulden, HG','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(462,48,29618308,'1875-5631','Genetics and Therapies for GM2 Gangliosidosis.','Tay-Sachs disease, caused by impaired β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, was the first GM2 gangliosidosis to be studied and one of the most severe and earliest lysosomal diseases to be described.

Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant  alleles in those iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic -corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids, but not the -corrected organoids, accumulated GM2 ganglioside and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the -corrected organoids.

Biopharmaceutical companies face complex challenges in developing treatments for rare diseases. Patient advocacy organizations may play a major role by positively influencing research and development, clinical trials, and regulations. Thus, collaboration among patient advocacy organizations and industry is essential to bring new therapeutics to patients.We identified an unmet need for guidelines on day-to-day decision-making by rare disease patient advocacy organizations when working with biopharmaceutical partners. We convened an Independent Expert Panel experienced in collaborations between patient advocacy organizations and biopharmaceutical companies (April 2017) to develop consensus guidelines for these relationships. The guidelines were based on an original version by the International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association (IFOPA). The Expert Panel reviewed and broadened these to be applicable to all patient advocacy organizations. Comments on the draft Guidelines were provided first by Panel participants and subsequently by six independent experts from patient advocacy organizations and industry.The Panel comprised four experts from the rare disease community who lead patient advocacy organizations; three leaders who perform advocacy functions within biopharmaceutical companies; and two facilitators, both having leadership experience in rare diseases and industry. The finalized Guidelines consist of four main sections: Identification and Engagement With Companies, Patient Engagement and Patient Privacy, Financial Contributions, and Clinical Trial Communication and Support. The Guidelines address the daily considerations, choices, and consequences of patient advocacy organizations as they engage with biopharmaceutical companies, and offer recommendations for volunteer/paid leaders of the organizations on how to interact in a thoughtful, responsible, ethical way that engenders trust.These Guidelines recommend best practices and standards for interactions between patient advocacy organizations and industry that will ultimately have a positive effect on the development of novel treatments.

Although progressive brain atrophy is characteristic, longitudinal quantification of specific brain structures has not been systematically studied.The goal of this longitudinal study has been to quantify and track brain MRI volume changes, including specific structure volume changes, at different times in disease progression of childhood gangliosidoses, and to explore quantitative brain MRI volumetry (qMRI) as a non-invasive marker of disease progression for future treatment trials.Brain qMRI studies were performed in 14 patients with gangliosidoses (9 infantile, 5 juvenile) yearly. Cerebellar cortex and white matter, caudate, putamen, corpus callosum, ventricles, total brain, and intracranial volumes were measured, as well as total brain volume. Age-matched controls were available for the patients with the juvenile phenotype.The infantile phenotype of all gangliosidoses showed a consistent pattern of macrocephaly and rapidly increasing intracranial MRI volume with both (a) brain tissue volume (cerebral cortex and other smaller structures) and (b) ventricular volume (P<0.01 for all). In contrast to apparent enlargement of the total brain volume, and chiefly the enlarged cerebral cortex, a subset of smaller brain substructures generally decreased in size: the corpus callosum, caudate and putamen became smaller with time. The volume of cerebellar cortex also decreased in patients with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis and juvenile GM1- and GM2-gangliosidosis; however, infantile GM2-gangliosidosis cerebellar cortex was the exception, increasing in size. Elevated intracranial pressure (estimated by lumbar spinal pressure) was a common finding in infantile disease and showed continued increases as the disease progressed, yet lacked MRI signs of hydrocephalus except for increasing ventricular size. Notably, in patients with juvenile gangliosidosis, macrocephaly and elevated intracranial pressure were absent and total brain volume decreased with time compared to controls (P=0.004).The disease course of infantile versus juvenile gangliosidoses is clearly distinguished by the rate of brain disease progression as characterized by qMRI. Assessments by qMRI represent a robust non-invasive method for monitoring CNS changes in the clinical course of gangliosidoses and is ideally suited to monitor effects of novel CNS-directed therapies in future clinical trials.','2018-02-01 00:00:00','2017-12-20 00:00:00','2018-03-02 00:00:00',0,0,'Nestrasil, Igor, I|Ahmed, Alia, A|Utz, Josephine M, JM|Rudser, Kyle, K|Whitley, Chester B, CB|Jarnes-Utz, Jeanine R, JR','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(467,48,29214523,'2192-8304','Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Arrests the Progression of Neurodegenerative Disease in Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease.','Tay-Sachs disease is a rare metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of hexosaminidase A that leads to accumulation of GM2 gangliosides predominantly in neural tissue.

Interestingly, the kidneys are among the most sensitive organ systems to sphingolipid alterations, rendering these molecules and the enzymes involved in their metabolism, promising therapeutic targets for numerous nephropathic complications that stand behind podocyte injury and renal failure.','2017-11-25 00:00:00','2017-11-25 00:00:00','2018-01-09 00:00:00',0,0,'Abou Daher, Alaa, A|El Jalkh, Tatiana, T|Eid, Assaad A, AA|Fornoni, Alessia, A|Marples, Brian, B|Zeidan, Youssef H, YH','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(469,48,29152458,'2214-6490','Lysosomal storage diseases.','Lysosomes are cytoplasmic organelles that contain a variety of different hydrolases. A genetic deficiency in the enzymatic activity of one of these hydrolases will lead to the accumulation of the material meant for lysosomal degradation. Examples include glycogen in the case of Pompe disease, glycosaminoglycans in the case of the mucopolysaccharidoses, glycoproteins in the cases of the oligosaccharidoses, and sphingolipids in the cases of Niemann-Pick disease types A and B, Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Sometimes, the lysosomal storage can be caused not by the enzymatic deficiency of one of the hydrolases, but by the deficiency of an activator protein, as occurs in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. Still other times, the accumulated lysosomal material results from failed egress of a small molecule as a consequence of a deficient transporter, as in cystinosis or Salla disease. In the last couple of decades, enzyme replacement therapy has become available for a number of lysosomal storage diseases. Examples include imiglucerase, taliglucerase and velaglucerase for Gaucher disease, laronidase for Hurler disease, idursulfase for Hunter disease, elosulfase for Morquio disease, galsulfase for Maroteaux-Lamy disease, alglucosidase alfa for Pompe disease, and agalsidase alfa and beta for Fabry disease. In addition, substrate reduction therapy has been approved for certain disorders, such as eliglustat for Gaucher disease. The advent of treatment options for some of these disorders has led to newborn screening pilot studies, and ultimately to the addition of Pompe disease and Hurler disease to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2015 and 2016, respectively.','2017-05-25 00:00:00','2017-05-25 00:00:00','2017-12-19 00:00:00',0,0,'Ferreira, Carlos R, CR|Gahl, William A, WA','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(470,48,29143882,'1432-0614','Enzymatic properties of β-N-acetylglucosaminidases.','β-N-Acetylglucosaminidases (GlcNAcases) hydrolyse N-acetylglucosamine-containing oligosaccharides and proteins.

This cofactor was found to be missing in human variant AB Tay-Sachs disease. Over the years, the GM2-AP has also been shown to be involved in kidney vesicular transport, lipid presentation by CD1 molecule to T-cells, and interaction of human sperm with zona pellucida. Since the expression of the GM2-AP via mRNA detection in mouse tissues was found to be the highest in testis, we became interested in the localization of the GM2-AP at cellular level in mouse testis during spermatogenesis. Using immunohistochemical analysis and electron microscopy, we found that the GM2-AP was predominantly localized in the basal cytoplasm and the attenuated processes of Sertoli cells. The stained structure appeared to be lysosomes. The most interesting finding was the association of the GM2-AP with the acrosomal apparatus in early spermatids. A modest to intense staining was observed in some acrosomal granules and acrosomal caps. The GM2-AP seemed to disappear from acrosomal caps in the later stage of spermatids, in which the nucleus became elongated and condensed. These results suggest that the GM2-AP may be involved in the normal functions of Sertoli cells and play important roles during the development of acrosomal caps in the early spermatids.','2017-12-01 00:00:00','2017-11-01 00:00:00','2017-12-08 00:00:00',0,0,'Li, Yu-Teh, YT|Li, Su-Chen, SC|Chen, I-Li, IL','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(472,49,29765775,'2059-7908','Potential impact of introducing the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into national immunisation programmes: an economic-epidemiological analysis using data from India.','Pneumococcal pneumonia causes an estimated 105 000 child deaths in India annually. The planned introduction of the serotype-based pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is expected to avert child deaths, but the high cost of PCV relative to current vaccines provided under the Universal Immunization Programme has been a concern. Cost-effectiveness studies from high-income countries are not readily comparable because of differences in the distribution of prevalent serotypes, population and health systems. We extended IndiaSim, our agent-based simulation model representative of the Indian population and health system, to model the dynamics of . This enabled us to evaluate serotype and overall disease dynamics in the context of the local population and health system, an aspect that is missing in prospective evaluations of the vaccine. We estimate that PCV13 introduction would cost approximately US$240 million and avert US$48.7 million in out-of-pocket expenditures and 34 800 (95% CI 29 600 to 40 800) deaths annually assuming coverage levels and distribution similar to DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccination (~77%). Introducing the vaccine protects the population, especially the poorest wealth quintile, from potentially catastrophic expenditure. The net-present value of predicted money-metric value of insurance for 20 years of vaccination is US$160 000 (95% CI US$151 000 to US$168 000) per 100 000 under-fives, and almost half of this protection is for the bottom wealth quintile (US$78 000; 95% CI 70 800 to 84 400). Extending vaccination to 90% coverage averts additional lives and provides additional financial risk protection. Our estimates are sensitive to immunity parameters in our model; however, our assumptions are conservative, and if willingness to pay per years of life lost averted is US$228 or greater, then introducing the vaccine is more cost-effective than our baseline (no vaccination) in more than 95% of simulations.','2018-05-17 00:00:00','2018-05-09 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Megiddo, Itamar, I|Klein, Eili, E|Laxminarayan, Ramanan, R','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(473,49,29764539,'1559-6109','Effect of Chronic Social Stress on Prenatal Transfer of Antitetanus Immunity in Captive Breeding Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta).','Because tetanus can cause significant morbidity and mortality in NHP, colonywide vaccination with tetanus toxoid is recommendedfor outdoor breeding colonies of rhesus macaques, with primary immunizations commonly given to infants at 6 mo of age followed by booster vaccines every 10 y. Maternal antibodies are thought to offer protective immunity to infants younger than 6 mo. However, historical colony data from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center show a higher incidence of tetanus among infants (≤ 6 mo old) born to subordinate dams. Whether this higher incidence of infantile tetanus is due to a higher incidence of trauma among subordinate animals or is a stress-induced impairment of maternal antibody protection is unknown. Studies in other NHP species suggest that chronic exposure to social stressors interferes with the receptor-mediated transplacental transfer of IgG. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine whether chronic stress associated with social subordination impairs prenatal transfer of antitetanus immunity in breeding female rhesus macaques. Subjects included 26 high- and 26 low-ranking adult female rhesus macaques that were nearly 5 or 10 y after their initial immunization and their nonimmunized infants. We hypothesized that infants born to subordinate dams that were nearly 10 y after immunization would have the lowest infant-to-dam antibody ratios and thus would be at greatest risk for infection. Results revealed no significant intergroup differences in infant antitetanus IgG levels. However, infant-to-dam IgG ratios against tetanus were significantly lower among subordinate animals compared with dominant macaques, after accounting for the number of years since the dam\'s initial vaccination. In addition, higher maternal hair cortisol levels predicted lower infant-to-dam tetanus toxoid IgG ratios. Together, these findings suggest that chronic social stress in female rhesus macaques may hamper the prenatal transfer of antitetanus immunity to offspring.','2018-05-15 00:00:00','2018-05-15 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00',0,0,'Stammen, Rachelle L, RL|Cohen, Joyce K, JK|Meeker, Tracy L, TL|Crane, Maria M, MM|Amara, Rama R, RR|Hicks, Sakeenah L, SL|Meyer, Jerrold S, JS|Ethun, Kelly F, KF','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(474,49,29762363,'1532-0987','Immunogenicity and Safety of Primary and Booster Vaccinations of a Fully Liquid DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T Hexavalent Vaccine in Healthy Infants and Toddlers in Germany and the Czech Republic.','To support a fully liquid, diphtheria (D)-tetanus (T)-acellular pertussis (aP)-inactivated poliovirus (IPV)-hepatitis B (HB)-Haemophilus influenzae b (PRP-T) vaccine in Europe using a 2, 3, 4 month primary series and a booster at 11 to 15 months of age.Phase III, randomized, observer-blind studies in Germany and the Czech Republic.

The raised polyclonal antibodies were capable of specific and sensitive hTSH detection, while the cross reactivity with the other members of the glycoprotein hormone family was minimum and negligible.

Long peptide vaccines are considered favorable vaccine moieties from a clinical perspective, as they can harbor more than one immunogenic epitope enabling treatment of a broader target population. In addition, longer peptides are not extracellularly loaded on MHC class I; rather, they require intracellular processing and will thereby be presented to T cells mainly by professional APCs, thereby avoiding the risk of tolerance induction. The drawback of peptide vaccines regardless of peptide length is that naked peptides are not actively targeted to and taken up by APCs, and the standard nonconjugated adjuvant-peptide mixtures do not ensure cotargeting of the two to the same APC. We have identified a tetanus toxin-derived B cell epitope that can mediate the formation of immune complexes in the presence of circulating Abs. In this study, we show that these immune complexes improve both Ag uptake by APCs (blood monocytes and CD1c dendritic cells) and consequently improve CD8 T cell recall responses in a human ex vivo blood loop system. The uptake of the peptide conjugate by blood monocytes is dependent on Abs and the complement component C1q.

It occurs as a sporadic mutation in approximately 80% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) or it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. People with achondroplasia have short stature, with an average adult height of 131 centimeters (52 inches) for males and 123 centimeters (48 inches) for females. Achondroplastic adults are known to be as short as 62.8 cm (24.7 in). If both parents of a child have achondroplasia, and both parents pass on the mutant gene, then it is very unlikely that the homozygous child will live past a few months of its life. The prevalence is approximately 1 in 25,000.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Jason_Acuña_-_Wee-Man_-_Waterfront_Marriott,_Portland,_Oregon_-_August_15,_2009_-_Full_Body.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achondroplasia','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(2,'Adrenoleukodystrophy',52952,742583592,'DOID_10588','Adrenoleukodystrophy (/-ˌlu-koʊ-ˈdis-trə-fiː/; also known as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, ALD, X-ALD, Siemerling–Creutzfeldt disease or bronze Schilder disease) is a disease that is linked on the X chromosome. It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats. These fats build up in the brain. They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves. This can cause seizures and hyperactivity. It can also cause problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy). ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0). The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. Treatment options for ALD are limited. Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo\'s oil. For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course. Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated. ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000. It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Adrenoleukodystrophy.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrenoleukodystrophy','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(3,'Agoraphobia',57723,744775147,'DOID_593','Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. These situations can include open spaces, public transit, shopping malls, or simply being outside the home. Being in these situations may result in a panic attack. The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and lasts for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes. The cause of agoraphobia is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5 agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. Those affected are at higher risk of depression and substance use disorder. Without treatment it is uncommon for agoraphobia to resolve. Treatment is typically with a type of counselling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT results in resolution for about half of people. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of adults. Women are affected about twice as often as men. The condition often begins in early adulthood and becomes less common in old age. It is rare in children. The term \"agoraphobia\" is from Greek ἀγορά, meaning a \"public square\" and -φοβία, -phobia, meaning \"fear\".','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Agora_of_the_Competaliasts_01_(cropped).jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agoraphobia','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(4,'Allergy',55313,743523311,'DOID_1205','Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little or no problem in most people. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. Common allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body\'s immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person\'s medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear. Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, about 6% of people have at least one food allergy, and about 20% have atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country about 1–18% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing.

The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development. As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome. AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized.

There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder. The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, a family history of mental disorders, and poverty. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other psychiatric and medical problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine , alcohol or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs. Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioural therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may improve symptoms. About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year. They occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common are specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life.

These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person they may become worse at night or with exercise. Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. There is no cure for asthma. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required. In 2013, 242 million people globally had asthma up from 183 million in 1990. It caused about 489,000 deaths in 2013, most of which occurred in the developing world. It often begins in childhood. The rates of asthma have increased significantly since the 1960s.

The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people.

Types of cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and broken heart syndrome. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens. In dilated cardiomyopathy the ventricles enlarge and weaken. In restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricle stiffens. The cause is frequently unknown. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often and dilated cardiomyopathy in a third of cases, is inherited from a person\'s parents. Dilated cardiomyopathy may also result from alcohol, heavy metals, coronary heart disease, cocaine use, and viral infections. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be caused by amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and some cancer treatments. Broken heart syndrome is caused by extreme emotional or physical stress. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the degree of symptoms. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery. In 2013 cardiomyopathy and myocarditis affected 7.9 million people. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects about 1 in 500 people while dilated cardiomyopathy affects 1 in 2,500.

The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected. Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. It is unclear if diabetes plays a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools, and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms, and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely. Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. Further splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy. About 5% of people in the United States have carpal tunnel syndrome. It usually begins in adulthood and women are more commonly affected than men.

It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000 deaths. This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer. About 70% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries. In low-income countries, it is the most common cause of cancer death. In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically reduced rates of cervical cancer.

Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur. Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes. The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold.

The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairymaids were immune from smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner. The word “vaccination,” coined by Jenner in 1796, is derived from the Latin root vaccinus, meaning of or from the cow. Once vaccinated, a patient develops antibodies that make him/her immune to cowpox, but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus, or Variola virus. The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980, the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide.

Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and infertility in males, among others. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. When CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing. Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world. No cure for cystic fibrosis is known. Lung infections are treated with antibiotics which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes, the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important, especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short-term benefit, but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis. CF is most common among people of Northern European ancestry and affects about one out of every 3,000 newborns.

Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA. A novel vaccine for dengue fever has been approved in three countries, but it is not yet commercially available. Prevention is by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used. Dengue has become a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110 countries. Each year between 50 and 528 million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Denguerash.JPG?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dengue_fever','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(19,'Dermatitis',57713,744838451,'DOID_2723','Dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a group of diseases that results in inflammation of the skin. These diseases are characterized by itchiness, red skin, and a rash. In cases of short duration there may be small blisters while in long term cases the skin may become thickened. The area of skin involved can vary from small to the entire body. Dermatitis is a group of skin conditions that includes atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination of irritation, allergy, and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person\'s history and the location of the rash. For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet. Allergic contact dermatitis; however, can occur following brief exposures to specific substances to which a person is sensitive. Treatment of atopic dermatitis is typically with moisturizers and steroid creams. The steroid creams should generally be of mid to high strength and used for less than two weeks at a time as side effects can occur. Antibiotics may be required if there are signs of skin infection. Contact dermatitis is typically treated by avoiding the allergen or irritant. Antihistamines may be used to help with sleep and to decrease nighttime scratching. Dermatitis was estimated to affect 334 million people globally in 2013. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type and generally starts in childhood. In the United States it affects about 10-30% of people. Contact dermatitis is two times more common in females than males. Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 7% of people at some point in time. Irritant contact dermatitis is common, especially among people who do certain jobs, however exact rates are unclear.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Dermatitis2015.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dermatitis','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(20,'Diabetes insipidus',44738,743800407,'DOID_9409','Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of severely dilute urine, with reduction of fluid intake having no effect on the concentration of the urine. There are different types of DI, each with a different set of causes. The most common type in humans is the neurological form, called central DI (CDI), which involves a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The second common type of DI is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which is due to kidney or nephron dysfunction caused by an insensitivity of the kidneys or nephrons to ADH. DI can also be gestational, or caused by alcohol or some types of drug abuse. DI should not be confused with nocturia. Although they have a common name, diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are two entirely separate conditions with unrelated mechanisms. Both cause large amounts of urine to be produced (polyuria). However, diabetes insipidus is either a problem with the production of antidiuretic hormone (central diabetes insipidus) or kidney\'s response to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), whereas diabetes mellitus causes polyuria via a process called osmotic diuresis, due to the high blood sugar leaking into the urine and taking excess water along with it. The number of new cases of diabetes insipidus each year is 3 in 100,000. Diabetes insipidus usually starts in childhood or early adulthood and affects men more commonly than women.

It happens predominantly in those with type 1 diabetes, but it can occur in those with type 2 diabetes under certain circumstances. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids and producing acidic ketone bodies that cause most of the symptoms and complications. DKA may be the first symptom of previously undiagnosed diabetes, but it may also occur in people known to have diabetes as a result of a variety of causes, such as intercurrent illness or poor compliance with insulin therapy. Vomiting, dehydration, deep gasping breathing, confusion and occasionally coma are typical symptoms. DKA is diagnosed with blood and urine tests; it is distinguished from other, rarer forms of ketoacidosis by the presence of high blood sugar levels. Treatment involves intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, insulin to suppress the production of ketone bodies, treatment for any underlying causes such as infections, and close observation to prevent and identify complications. DKA is a medical emergency, and without treatment it can lead to death. DKA was first described in 1886; until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s, it was almost universally fatal.

It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including hyperthyroidism, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, a number of medications, and irritable bowel syndrome. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause. Prevention of infectious diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding for at least six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Antibiotics, while rarely used, may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool. Loperamide may help decrease the number of bowel movements but is not recommended in those with severe disease. About 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.26 million in 2013 – down from 2.58 million in 1990. In 2012, it was the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age.

These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children. Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent. DID is one of the most controversial psychiatric disorders, with no clear consensus on diagnostic criteria or treatment. Research on treatment efficacy has been concerned primarily with clinical approaches and case studies. Dissociative symptoms range from common lapses in attention, becoming distracted by something else, and daydreaming, to pathological dissociative disorders. No systematic, empirically supported definition of \"dissociation\" exists. It is not the same as schizophrenia. Although neither epidemiological surveys nor longitudinal studies have been conducted, it is generally believed that DID rarely resolves spontaneously. Symptoms are said to vary over time. In general, the prognosis is poor, especially for those with comorbid disorders. There are few systematic data on the prevalence of DID. The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation states that the prevalence is between 1 and 3% in the general population, and between 1 and 5% in inpatient groups in Europe and North America. DID is diagnosed more frequently in North America than in the rest of the world, and is diagnosed three to nine times more often in females than in males. The prevalence of DID diagnoses increased greatly in the latter half of the 20th century, along with the number of identities (often referred to as \"alters\") claimed by patients (increasing from an average of two or three to approximately 16). DID is also controversial within the legal system, where it has been used as a rarely successful form of the insanity defense. The 1990s showed a parallel increase in the number of court cases involving the diagnosis. Dissociative disorders including DID have been attributed to disruptions in memory caused by trauma and other forms of stress, but research on this hypothesis has been characterized by poor methodology. So far, scientific studies, usually focusing on memory, have been few and the results have been inconclusive. An alternative hypothesis for the cause of DID is as a by-product of techniques employed by some therapists, especially those using hypnosis, and disagreement between the two positions is characterized by intense debate. DID became a popular diagnosis in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, but it is unclear if the actual rate of the disorder increased, if it was more recognized by health care providers, or if sociocultural factors caused an increase in therapy-induced (iatrogenic) presentations. The unusual number of diagnoses after 1980, clustered around a small number of clinicians and the suggestibility characteristic of those with DID, support the hypothesis that DID is therapist-induced. The unusual clustering of diagnoses has also been explained as due to a lack of awareness and training among clinicians to recognize cases of DID.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Dissociative_identity_disorder.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dissociative_identity_disorder','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(25,'Ectopic pregnancy',54309,742820539,'DOID_0060329','Ectopic pregnancy, also known as eccyesis or tubal pregnancy, is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Less than 50 percent of women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock. With very rare exceptions the fetus is unable to survive. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include: pelvic inflammatory disease, often due to Chlamydia infection, tobacco smoking, prior tubal surgery, a history of infertility, and the use of assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an ectopic pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the Fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies. Implantation can also occur on the cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen. Detection of ectopic pregnancy is typically by blood tests for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Ultrasound works best when performed from within the vagina. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage, ovarian torsion, and acute appendicitis. Prevention is by decreasing risk factors such as chlamydia infections through screening and treatment. While some ectopic pregnancies will resolve without treatment, this approach has not been well studied as of 2014. The use of the medication methotrexate works as well as surgery in some cases. Specifically it works well when the beta-HCG is low and the size of the ectopic is small. Surgery is still typically recommended if the tube has ruptured, there is a fetal heartbeat, or the person\'s vital signs are unstable. The surgery may be laparoscopic or through a larger incision, known as a laparotomy. Outcomes are generally good with treatment. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is about 1 and 2% that of live births in developed countries, though it may be as high as 4% among those using assisted reproductive technology. It is the most common cause of death during the first trimester at approximately 10% of the total. In the developed world outcomes have improved while in the developing world they often remain poor. The risk of death among those in the developed world is between 0.1 and 0.3 percent while in the developing world it is between one and three percent.

Endometriosis can have both social and psychological effects. The cause is not entirely clear. Risk factors include having a family history of the condition. Most often the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue around the uterus and ovaries are affected; however, in rare cases it may also occur in other parts of the body. The areas of endometriosis bleed each month, resulting in inflammation and scarring. The growths due to endometriosis are not cancer. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms in combination with medical imaging. Biopsy is the most sure method of diagnosis. Other causes of similar symptoms include pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia. Tentative evidence suggests that the use of combined oral contraceptives reduces the risk of endometriosis. Exercise and avoiding large amounts of alcohol may also be preventative. There is no cure for endometriosis, but a number of treatments may improve symptoms. This may include pain medication, hormonal treatments, or surgery. The recommended pain medication is usually an NSAID such as naproxen. Taking the active component of the birth control pill continuously or using an intrauterine device with progestogen may also be useful. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist may improve the ability of those who are infertile to get pregnant.

About a third of people have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech. Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%. Males are usually more affected than females. Fragile X syndrome is typically due to the expansion of the  CGG triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. This results in a failure to express the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal neural development. Depending on the length of the CGG repeat, an allele may be classified as normal (unaffected by the syndrome), a premutation (at risk of fragile X associated disorders), or full mutation (usually affected by the syndrome). A diagnosis of fragile X syndrome is made through genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats. Testing for premutation carriers may allow for genetic counseling. There is no medication that has a benefit specifically for fragile X syndrome. Medications are commonly used to treat symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety, and aggression.

It is due to a lactase deficiency, or hypolactasia. In extremely rare cases, mainly limited to Finland, individuals have congenital alactasia, a total absence of lactase caused by a genetic defect, which prevents them from being able to digest lactose from infancy, including breast milk. Lactose intolerant individuals have insufficient levels of lactase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, in their digestive system. In most cases, this causes symptoms which may include abdominal bloating and cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, borborygmi (rumbling stomach), or vomiting after consuming significant amounts of lactose. It is common for patients with inflammatory bowel disease to experience gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose ingestion, although the prevalence of lactase deficiency in this population has not been well studied. Most mammals normally cease to produce lactase (lactase nonpersistence), becoming lactose intolerant, after weaning, but some human populations have developed lactase persistence, in which lactase production continues into adulthood which likely developed as a response to growing benefits of being able to digest the milk of farm animals such as cattle. Research reveals intolerance to be more common globally than lactase persistence, and that the variation has been tied to genetics, but that the largest source of variation has been shown to be based on exposure (e.g., cultures that consume dairy). The frequency of lactose intolerance ranges from 5% in Northern European to more than 90% in some African and Asian countries. Some have argued that this links intolerance to natural selection favoring lactase-persistent individuals, but it is also consistent with a physiological response to decrease lactase production when it is not needed in cultures in which dairy products are not an available food source. Although populations in Europe, India, Arabia, and Africa were first thought to have high frequencies of lactase persistence because of a single mutation, lactase persistence has been traced to a number of mutations that occurred independently. Healthy people with lactase nonpersistence are able to consume at least one cup of milk without developing symptoms and this tolerance is improved by consuming the milk with a meal (preferably lactose-reduced milk), adding lactase supplements, or replacing milk by yogurt or hard cheeses.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Lactose_Haworth.svg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lactose_intolerance','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(33,'Leprosy',44700,743999739,'DOID_1024','Leprosy, also known as Hansen\'s disease (HD), is a long-term infection caused by the bacilli Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way for 5 to 20 years. Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This may result in a lack of ability to feel pain and thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries or infection due to unnoticed wounds. Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present. Leprosy is spread between people. This is believed to occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of an infected person. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty. Contrary to popular belief, it is not highly contagious. The two main types of disease are based on the number of bacteria present: paucibacillary and multibacillary. The two types are differentiated by the number of poorly pigmented, numb skin patches present, with paucibacillary having five or fewer and multibacillary having more than five. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin or by detecting the DNA using polymerase chain reaction. Leprosy is curable with a treatment known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported per year in the United States. Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Latin word lepra, which means \"scaly\", while the term \"Hansen\'s disease\" is named after the physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen. Separating people by placing them in leper colonies still occurs in places such as India, China, and Africa. However, most colonies have closed since leprosy is not very contagious. Social stigma has been associated with leprosy for much of history, which continues to be a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment. Some consider the word \"leper\" offensive, preferring the phrase \"person affected with leprosy\". World Leprosy Day was started in 1954 to draw awareness to those affected by leprosy.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Leprosy.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leprosy','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(34,'Marburg virus disease',58743,733027007,'DOID_4327','Marburg virus disease (MVD; formerly Marburg hemorrhagic fever) is a severe illness of humans and non-human primates caused by either of the two marburgviruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV).

The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm. Other commonly affected areas include the lungs, eyes, bones, and the covering of the spinal cord. Marfan is an autosomal dominant disorder. About 75% of the time the condition is inherited from a parent while 25% of the time it is a new mutation. It involves a mutation to the gene that makes fibrillin which results in abnormal connective tissue. Diagnosis is often based on the Ghent criteria. There is no cure for Marfan syndrome. Many people have a normal life expectancy with proper treatment. Management often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or if not tolerated calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. Surgery may be required to repair the aorta or replace a heart valve. It is recommended that hard exercise be avoided. About one in 3,000 to 10,000 individuals have Marfan syndrome. It occurs equally in males and females. Rates are similar between races and in different regions of the world.

English psychiatrist Henry Maudsley proposed an overarching category of affective disorder. The term was then replaced by mood disorder, as the latter term refers to the underlying or longitudinal emotional state, whereas the former refers to the external expression observed by others. Mood disorders fall into the basic groups of elevated mood, such as mania or hypomania; depressed mood, of which the best-known and most researched is major depressive disorder (MDD) (commonly called clinical depression, unipolar depression, or major depression); and moods which cycle between mania and depression, known as bipolar disorder (BD) (formerly known as manic depression). There are several sub-types of depressive disorders or psychiatric syndromes featuring less severe symptoms such as dysthymic disorder (similar to but milder than MDD) and cyclothymic disorder (similar to but milder than BD).

People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person\'s weight by the square of the person\'s height, is over 30 kg/m2, with the range 25–30 kg/m2 defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. Evidence to support the view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Obesity-waist_circumference.svg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obesity','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(38,'Pneumonia',52135,739440823,'DOID_552','Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \"the captain of the men of death\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \"the old man\'s friend\".','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/PneumonisWedge09.JPG?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pneumonia','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(39,'Polycystic ovary syndrome',54301,734695372,'DOID_11612','Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a set of symptoms due to elevated androgens (male hormones) in women. Signs and symptoms of PCOS include irregular or no menstrual periods, heavy periods, excess body and facial hair, acne, pelvic pain, difficulty getting pregnant, and patches of thick, darker, velvety skin. Associated conditions include type 2 diabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease, mood disorders, and endometrial cancer. PCOS is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include obesity, not enough physical exercise, and a family history of someone with the condition. Diagnosis is based on two of the following three findings: no ovulation, high androgen levels, and ovarian cysts. Cysts may be detectable by ultrasound. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include adrenal hyperplasia, hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia. PCOS has no cure. Treatment may involve lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise. Birth control pills may help with improving the regularity of periods, excess hair growth, and acne. Metformin and anti-androgens may also help. Other typical acne treatments and hair removal techniques may be used. Efforts to improve fertility include weight loss, clomiphene, or metformin. In vitro fertilization is used by some in whom other measures are not effective. PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder among women between the ages of 18 and 44. It affects approximately 2% to 20% of this age group depending on how it is defined. It is one of the leading causes of poor fertility.

In newborns symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. In childhood the person becomes constantly hungry which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. There is also typically mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems. Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height short, skin light in color, and they are unable to have children. About 70% of cases occur when part of the father\'s chromosome 15 is deleted. In another 25% of cases the person has two copies of chromosome 15 from their mother and none from their father. As parts of the chromosome from the mother\'s is turned off they end up with no working copies of certain genes. PWS is not generally inherited but instead the genetic changes happen during the formation of the egg, sperm, or in early development. There are no known risk factors. Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected. A similar mechanism occurs in Angelman syndrome except there is a defective chromosome 15 from the mother or two copies from the father. Prader–Willi syndrome has no cure. Treatment, however, may improve outcomes, especially if carried out early. In newborns feeding difficulties may be supported with feeding tubes. Strike food supervision is typically required starting around the age of three in combination with an exercise program. Growth hormone therapy also improves outcomes. Counseling and medications may help with some behavioral problems. Group homes are often necessary in adulthood. PWS affects between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 30,000 people. Males and females are affected equally. The condition is named after Andrea Prader, Heinrich Willi, and Alexis Labhart who described it in detail in 1956.

The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally tiny burrows may be seen in the skin. When first infected, usually two to six weeks are required before symptoms occur. If a person develops a second infection later in life, symptoms may begin within a day. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin. Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often only between ten and fifteen mites are involved in an infection. Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person such as that which may occur during sex. Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions such as those found in child care facilities, group homes, and prisons increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease. It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites, making them much more contagious. In these cases spread of infection may occur during brief contact or via contaminated objects. The mite is very small and usually not directly visible. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. A number of medications are available to treat those infected, including permethrin, crotamiton and lindane creams and ivermectin pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time there continue to be symptoms retreatment may be needed. Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. As of 2010 it affects approximately 100 million people (1.5% of the world population) and is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates. The word scabies is from Latin: scabere, \"to scratch\". Other animals do not spread human scabies.

The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are little to no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as \"the great imitator\" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases. Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity. It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested. The risk of syphilis can be decreased by latex condom use, or not having sex. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In those who have a severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer. In 2012 about 0.5% of adults were infected with syphilis with 6 million new cases. During 2010 it caused about 113,000 deaths, down from 202,000 in 1990. After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s, rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries, often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is believed to be partly due to increased promiscuity, prostitution, decreasing use of condoms, and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Treponema_pallidum.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syphilis','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(47,'Syringomyelia',29666,729256408,'DOID_327','Syringomyelia (/sᵻˌrɪŋɡəmaɪˈiːliə, -ɡoʊ-/) is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord.

In its most common variant (known as infantile Tay–Sachs disease), it causes a progressive deterioration of nerve cells and of mental and physical abilities that begins around 7 months of age and usually results in death by the age of four. The disease occurs when harmful quantities of cell membrane components known as gangliosides accumulate in the brain\'s nerve cells, eventually leading to the premature death of the cells. A ganglioside is a form of sphingolipid, which makes Tay–Sachs disease a member of the sphingolipidoses. There is no known cure or treatment. The disease is named after the British ophthalmologist Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and after the American neurologist Bernard Sachs of Mount Sinai Hospital, who described in 1887 the cellular changes of Tay–Sachs disease and noted an increased disease prevalence in Ashkenazi Jews. Research in the late 20th century demonstrated that Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. A large number of HEXA mutations have been discovered, and new ones are still being reported. These mutations reach significant frequencies in specific populations. French Canadians of southeastern Quebec have a carrier frequency similar to that seen in Ashkenazi Jews, but carry a different mutation. Cajuns of southern Louisiana carry the same mutation that is seen most commonly in Ashkenazi Jews. HEXA mutations are rare and are most seen in genetically isolated populations. Tay–Sachs can occur from the inheritance of either two similar, or two unrelated, causative mutations in the HEXA gene. As an autosomal recessive disorder, two Tay–Sachs alleles are required for an individual to exhibit symptoms of the disease. Carriers of a single Tay–Sachs allele do not exhibit symptoms of the disease but appear to be protected to some extent against tuberculosis. This accounts for the persistence of the allele in certain populations in that it confers a selective advantage—in other words, being a heterozygote is advantageous.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Tay-sachsUMich.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tay–Sachs_disease','2018-05-17 22:46:19','2018-05-17 22:46:19'),(49,'Tetanus',45831,738485422,'DOID_11338','Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is an infection characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks. Spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur. Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. It may take months to recover. About 10% of those infected die. Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil, dust and manure. The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object. They produce toxins that interfere with muscle contractions, resulting in the typical symptoms. Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms. The disease does not spread between people. Infection can be prevented by proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine. In those who have a significant wound and less than three doses of the vaccine both immunization and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. In those who are infected tetanus immune globulin or, if it is not available, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed. Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person\'s breathing is affected. Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil contains a lot of organic matter. In 2013 it caused about 59,000 deaths – down from 356,000 in 1990. Description of the disease by Hippocrates exists from at least as far back as the 5th century BC.
