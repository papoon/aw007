Here, we evaluated the protective effects of oleacein, one of the most abundant secoiridoids in EVOO, on the damages/metabolic alterations caused by high-fat diet (HFD) in male C57BL/6JolaHsd mice. After 5 weeks of treatment with 20 mg/kg of oleacein, body weight, glycemia, insulinemia, serum lipids, and histologic examination of liver tissue indicated a protective action of oleacein against abdominal fat accumulation, weight gain, and liver steatosis, with improvement of insulin-dependent glucose and lipid metabolism. Both serum parameters and hepatic histologic examination were altered in mice fed with HFD. By contrast, in the animals that received oleacein, plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, and liver histology were similar to controls fed with normocaloric diet. In addition, protein levels of FAS, SREBP-1, and phospho-ERK in liver were positively modulated by oleacein, indicating an improvement in liver insulin sensitivity. In a group of obese mice, treatment with oleacein determined a light, but still significant reduction of the increase in body weight, mainly due to lesser liver steatosis enlargement, associated with reduced levels of SREBP-1 and phospho-ERK and lower levels of total serum cholesterol; in these animals, altered plasma glucose and triglyceride serum levels were not reverted by oleacein. These results indicate that HFD-related hepatic insulin resistance may be partially prevented by oral administration of oleacein, suggesting a protective role of this nutraceutical against diet-dependent metabolic alterations. Additional studies are necessary to check whether oleacein can be used as an adjuvant to improve insulin sensitivity in humans.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-03-19 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Lombardo, Giovanni Enrico, GE|Lepore, Saverio Massimo, SM|Morittu, Valeria Maria, VM|Arcidiacono, Biagio, B|Colica, Carmela, C|Procopio, Antonio, A|Maggisano, Valentina, V|Bulotta, Stefania, S|Costa, Nicola, N|Mignogna, Chiara, C|Britti, Domenico, D|Brunetti, Antonio, A|Russo, Diego, D|Celano, Marilena, M','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(2,1,29615900,'1663-9812','Peripheral CB1 Receptor Neutral Antagonist, AM6545, Ameliorates Hypometabolic Obesity and Improves Adipokine Secretion in Monosodium Glutamate Induced Obese Mice.','Effect of peripheral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) blockade by AM6545 in the monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced hypometabolic and hypothalamic obesity was observed, and the impact on intraperitoneal adipose tissue and adipokines was investigated. The MSG mice is characterized by excessive abdominal obesity, and combined with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. 3-Week AM6545 treatment dose-dependently decreased the body weight, intraperitoneal fat mass, and rectified the accompanied dyslipidemia include elevated serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, and lowered LDLc level. Glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia were also alleviated. But AM6545 didn\'t affect the food-intake consistently through the experiment. In line with the reduction on fat mass, the size of adipocyte was reduced markedly. Most interestingly, AM6545 showed significant improvement on levels of circulating adipokines including lowering leptin, asprosin and TNFα, and increasing HMW adiponectin. Correspondingly, dysregulated gene expression of lipogenesis, lipolysis, and adipokines in the adipose tissue were nearly recovered to normal level after AM6545 treatment. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed that AM6545 corrected the elevated CB1R and PPARγ protein expression, while increased the key energy uncoupling protein UCP1 expression in adipose tissue. Taken together, the current study indicates that AM6545 induced a comprehensive metabolic improvement in the MSG mice including counteracting the hypometabolic and hypothalamic obesity, and improving the accompanied dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. One key underlying mechanism is related to ameliorate on the metabolic deregulation of adipose tissue, the synthesis and secretion of adipokines were thus rectified, and finally the catabolism was increased and the anabolism was reduced in intraperitoneal adipose tissue. Findings from this study will provide the valuable information about peripheral CB1R antagonist in managing hypometabolic obesity.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-03-20 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Ma, Haiming, H|Zhang, Guina, G|Mou, Chunrong, C|Fu, Xiujuan, X|Chen, Yadan, Y','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(3,1,29615407,'2044-6055','Effect of pasta in the context of low-glycaemic index dietary patterns on body weight and markers of adiposity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in adults.','Carbohydrate staples such as pasta have been implicated in the obesity epidemic. It is unclear whether pasta contributes to weight gain or like other low-glycaemic index (GI) foods contributes to weight loss. We synthesised the evidence of the effect of pasta on measures of adiposity.Systematic review and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched through 7 February 2017.We included randomised controlled trials ≥3 weeks assessing the effect of pasta alone or in the context of low-GI dietary patterns on measures of global (body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat) and regional (waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD)) adiposity in adults.Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (Istatistic). GRADE assessed the certainty of the evidence.We identified no trial comparisons of the effect of pasta alone and 32 trial comparisons (n=2448 participants) of the effect of pasta in the context of low-GI dietary patterns. Pasta in the context of low-GI dietary patterns significantly reduced body weight (MD=-0.63 kg; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.42 kg) and BMI (MD=-0.26 kg/m; 95% CI -0.36 to -0.16 kg/m) compared with higher-GI dietary patterns. There was no effect on other measures of adiposity. The certainty of the evidence was graded as moderate for body weight, BMI, WHR and SAD and low for WC and body fat.Pasta in the context of low-GI dietary patterns does not adversely affect adiposity and even reduces body weight and BMI compared with higher-GI dietary patterns. Future trials should assess the effect of pasta in the context of other \'healthy\' dietary patterns.NCT02961088; Results.','2018-04-02 00:00:00','2018-04-02 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Chiavaroli, Laura, L|Kendall, Cyril W C, CWC|Braunstein, Catherine R, CR|Blanco Mejia, Sonia, S|Leiter, Lawrence A, LA|Jenkins, David J A, DJA|Sievenpiper, John L, JL','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(4,1,29614976,'1471-2261','Primary results of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in the at-risk residents in middle China.','There is a lack of information on the epidemiological data and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in Chinese population. We reported the primary results from screening five-community population in Middle China for AAA.From March 2014 to October 2015, an AAA screening program was performed in three urban and two rural communities. These communities were randomly selected. All at-risk residents (a total of 6925) aged 40 years or older were invited to attend an ultrasound scan for AAA. At-risk population was defined as having a family history of first-degree relative diagnosed with AAA; or smoking and aged 55 years or older; or having a history of CAD, cerebrovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, obesity (BMI ≧ 26 kg/m) or hypertension.The study investigated 5402 subjects and the mean age of them was 61.2 ± 10.4 years old.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of having EH between hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients.Analysis showed that participants with anxiety, high body mass index, abdominal obesity and family history of hypertension had higher risk for EH, whereas those with bland diet and occupational physical activities had lower risk for EH. qPCR assays showed that NR_027032 (P = 0.015) and NR_034083 (P = 0.004) were significantly reduced in EH patients compared with controls, whereas NR_104181 (P = 0.007), miR-143 (P = 0.005) and miR-145 (P = 0.015) were significantly elevated. After controlling the cardiovascular risk factors, multivariate analysis showed that lower expression levels of NR_034083 and higher expression levels of NR_104181 and miR-143 were risk factors for EH.EH is a result of environmental and epigenetic factors. Strikingly, NR_034083, NR_104181 and miR-143 may be correlated with the risk for EH development; therefore, epigenetic markers could be used to measure hypertension levels to help elucidate the pathogenesis of EH.','2018-04-02 00:00:00','2018-04-02 00:00:00','2018-04-03 00:00:00','Chen, Shiying, S|Chen, Rong, R|Zhang, Tingxing, T|Lin, Shaowei, S|Chen, Zhou, Z|Zhao, Bi, B|Li, Huangyuan, H|Wu, Siying, S','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(8,1,29609238,'0254-6450','[Associations of obesity and physical activity with cognition in people aged 50 and above in Shanghai].','No abstract found.','2018-03-10 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-04-02 00:00:00','Huang, Z Z, ZZ|Zhang, Y C, YC|Zheng, Y, Y|Guo, Y F, YF|Ruan, Y, Y|Sun, S Y, SY|Shi, Y, Y|Gao, S N, SN|Ye, J H, JH|Yan, Y J, YJ|Wu, K, K|Xu, R F, RF|Wu, F, F','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(9,1,29605777,'2210-2612','Jejuno-gastric intussusception: A case report of unusual cause of food intolerance after roux-En-Y gastric bypass.','Morbid obesity is increasing worldwide as a result, weight loss procedures such as Roux- En-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are increasing as well.

Three are perinates and show no macroscopic or radiological evidence for a FGFR3 mutation causing hypo-or achondroplasia. This mutation induces dysfunction of the growth cartilage, leading to abnormalities in the development of trabecular bone. Because the mutation is autosomal dominant, these perinates have a 50% risk of having been affected. This study determines whether trabecular bone microarchitecture (TBMA) analysis is useful for detecting genetic dwarfism. Proximal metaphyses of humeri were μCT-scanned with a resolution of 7-12 μm. Three volumes of interest were segmented from each bone with TIVMI© software. The TBMA was quantified in BoneJ© using six parameters on which a multivariate analysis was then performed.

Chondrocyte hypertrophy is required for endochondral bone formation as chondrocytes secrete factors required for osteoblast differentiation and maturation. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signaling pathway is a key regulator of skeletal development and homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of Ihh in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Ihh was knocked down in mouse chondrocyte cells using short hairpin RNA. Chondrocyte apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were assessed using flow cytometry and the results indicated that knockdown of Ihh significantly inhibited cell growth (P<0.05) and increased apoptosis (P<0.001) compared with negative control cells. Downregulation of Ihh also resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 to S phase in chondrocytes. It was also observed that knockdown of Ihh decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral deposition of chondrocytes. The inhibitory roles of Ihh downregulation on chondrocyte growth and differentiation may be associated with the transforming growth factor-β/mothers against decapentaplegic and osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggest that chondrocyte-derived Ihh is essential for maintaining bone growth plates and that manipulation of Ihh expression or its signaling components may be a novel therapeutic technique for the treatment of skeletal diseases, including achondroplasia.','2018-01-01 00:00:00','2017-11-07 00:00:00','2018-02-14 00:00:00','Deng, Ang, A|Zhang, Hongqi, H|Hu, Minyu, M|Liu, Shaohua, S|Wang, Yuxiang, Y|Gao, Qile, Q|Guo, Chaofeng, C','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(21,3,29615068,'2045-8118','Modeling and rescue of defective blood-brain barrier function of induced brain microvascular endothelial cells from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy patients.','X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. 40% of X-ALD patients will convert to the deadly childhood cerebral form (ccALD) characterized by increased permeability of the brain endothelium that constitutes the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mutation information and molecular markers investigated to date are not predictive of conversion. Prior reports have focused on toxic metabolic byproducts and reactive oxygen species as instigators of cerebral inflammation and subsequent immune cell invasion leading to BBB breakdown. This study focuses on the BBB itself and evaluates differences in brain endothelium integrity using cells from ccALD patients and wild-type (WT) controls.The blood-brain barrier of ccALD patients and WT controls was modeled using directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs). Immunocytochemistry and PCR confirmed characteristic expression of brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) markers. Barrier properties of iBMECs were measured via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), sodium fluorescein permeability, and frayed junction analysis. Electron microscopy and RNA-seq were used to further characterize disease-specific differences. Oil-Red-O staining was used to quantify differences in lipid accumulation. To evaluate whether treatment with block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) (PEO-PPO) could mitigate defective properties, ccALD-iBMECs were treated with PEO-PPO block copolymers and their barrier properties and lipid accumulation levels were quantified.iBMECs from patients with ccALD had significantly decreased TEER (2592 ± 110 Ω cm) compared to WT controls (5001 ± 172 Ω cm). They also accumulated lipid droplets to a greater extent than WT-iBMECs. Upon treatment with a PEO-PPO diblock copolymer during the differentiation process, an increase in TEER and a reduction in lipid accumulation were observed for the polymer treated ccALD-iBMECs compared to untreated controls.The finding that BBB integrity is decreased in ccALD and can be rescued with block copolymers opens the door for the discovery of BBB-specific molecular markers that can indicate the onset of ccALD and has therapeutic implications for preventing the conversion to ccALD.','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Lee, Catherine A A, CAA|Seo, Hannah S, HS|Armien, Anibal G, AG|Bates, Frank S, FS|Tolar, Jakub, J|Azarin, Samira M, SM','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(22,3,29599883,'1937-8688','[Overview of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in Morocco: results of the implementation of the program of clinical and biological diagnosis].','X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, due to mutations in the ABCD1 gene.

All children were diagnosed with demyelinating brain. All heterozygous women were asymptomatic. Different symptom-based therapies were established.X-ALD is a rare disease.

However, little is known about patients\' daily-life adaptive functional outcomes (i.e., ability to communicate, maintain social relationships, and independently execute tasks of daily living). The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to identify which patient characteristics and treatment-related variables predict long-term adaptive function among the survivors of HSCT for cALD.We obtained caregiver ratings of adaptive functioning of 65 transplant survivors at an average of 4.6 years (range: 1.0-24.1 years) post-HSCT. Using linear regression with penalized maximum likelihood estimation, we modeled the relative contribution of pre-transplant neurocognitive test performance, MRI severity, transplant regimen, and length of time since transplant on patient adaptive functioning outcomes.Higher radiographic disease severity and poorer performance on baseline neurocognitive tests requiring fine motor skills and visual perception were associated with inferior adaptive functioning after HSCT. Use of radiation during the transplant preparative regimen also predicted poorer adaptive outcomes.In addition to radiological disease severity, baseline neurocognitive test performance is associated with post-transplant adaptive functional outcomes.

The typical alteration revealed in neuroimaging scans in the cerebral form is symmetrical periventricular demyelination with posterior location.We report the case of a 10-year-old boy with right spastic hemiparesis and subacute cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed symmetrical involvement of the white matter in the left frontoparietotemporal region, and calcifications were observed in the computerised axial tomography scan. X-ALD was confirmed by means of the elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids, and a pathogenic variant was found in the ABCD1 gene.Symmetrical demyelination with calcifications has rarely been reported in X-ALD, and these findings could delay diagnosis.

Patients with ZSD commonly demonstrate nonspecific hepatic symptoms within the first year, often without clinical suspicion of ZSD. Thus, recognition of pathologic findings in the liver is critical for the early diagnosis. We herein demonstrate the histologic and ultrastructural features in liver biopsies in the early and advanced phases from a 16-year-old male with IRD. The initial biopsy at 5 months of age showed a lack of peroxisomes by EM, and this finding played a critical role in the early diagnosis. In contrast, the second biopsy at 14 years of age, after long-term diet therapy, demonstrated significant disease progression with near-cirrhotic liver. In addition to lack of peroxisomes, EM revealed abundant trilamellar inclusions within large angulated lysosomes in many of the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Mitochondrial abnormalities were identified only in the second biopsy and were mainly identified in damaged cells; thus they were likely nonspecific secondary changes.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare neurometabolic condition exhibiting discordant phenotypes, ranging from a childhood cerebral inflammatory demyelination (cALD) to an adult-onset mild axonopathy in spinal cords (AMN). The AMN form may occur with superimposed inflammatory brain demyelination (cAMN). All patients harbor loss of function mutations in the ABCD1 peroxisomal transporter of very-long chain fatty acids. The factors that account for the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, even within the same family, remain largely unknown. To gain insight into this matter, here we compared the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of morphologically intact frontal white matter areas of children affected by cALD with adult cAMN patients, including male controls in the same age group. We identified a common methylomic signature between the two phenotypes, comprising i) hypermethylation of genes harboring the H3K27me3 mark at promoter regions, ii) hypermethylation of genes with major roles in oligodendrocyte differentiation such as MBP, CNP, MOG and PLP1, and iii) hypomethylation of immune-associated genes such as IFITM1 and CD59. Moreover, we found increased hypermethylation in CpGs of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, and also in genes with H3K27me3 marks in their promoter regions in cALD compared with cAMN, correlating with transcriptional and translational changes. Further, using a penalized logistic regression model, we identified the combined methylation levels of SPG20, UNC45A and COL9A3 and also, the combined expression levels of ID4 and MYRF to be good markers capable of discriminating childhood from adult inflammatory phenotypes. We thus propose the hypothesis that an epigenetically controlled, altered transcriptional program may drive an impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation and aberrant immune activation in X-ALD patients.

VLCFA-containing lipids accumulate in X-ALD patients, although the effect of ABCD1-deficiency on each lipid species in the central nervous system has not been fully characterized. In this study, each phospholipid and lysophospholipid species in Abcd1-deficient mice brains were profiled by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the phospholipid and lysophospholipid species that are significantly more enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, VLCFA were present in 75, 15, 5, 4, and 1 species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Most VLCFA were incorporated at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Among the phospholipid species that are significantly less enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, odd-numbered saturated or mono-unsaturated fatty acyl moieties are contained in all phosphatidylcholine species. In addition, a number of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine species contained highly unsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Intriguingly, 44:1 phosphatidylcholine with VLCFA was mainly distributed in the gray matter, such as the cortex, but not in the white matter in the cerebrum and cerebellum. These results show that ABCD1-deficiency causes metabolic alternation of long-chain fatty acids and VLCFA. Moreover, our results imply a molecular mechanism for the incorporation of saturated or monounsaturated VLCFA into the sn-1 position of phospholipids, and also indicate that the distribution of phospholipids with VLCFA may correlate with the development of X-ALD.','2018-01-01 00:00:00','2018-02-22 00:00:00','2018-03-19 00:00:00','Hama, Kotaro, K|Fujiwara, Yuko, Y|Morita, Masashi, M|Yamazaki, Fumiyoshi, F|Nakashima, Yuko, Y|Takei, Shiro, S|Takashima, Shigeo, S|Setou, Mitsutoshi, M|Shimozawa, Nobuyuki, N|Imanaka, Tsuneo, T|Yokoyama, Kazuaki, K','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(28,3,29446847,'1558-9307','Lipidomic Analysis: From Archaea to Mammals.','Lipids are among the most important organic compounds found in all living cells, from primitive archaebacteria to flowering plants or mammalian cells.

As a consequence, we conclude that psychiatric disorders and HIV/AIDS treatment should be addressed simultaneously, depending on the risk specific factors such as the HIV infection stage and, due to psychiatric repercussions of HIV is expected to become more relevant in the coming years.','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-28 00:00:00','2018-03-29 00:00:00','Ursoiu, Fulvia, F|Moleriu, Lavinia, L|Lungeanu, Diana, D|Puschită, Maria, M','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(31,4,29580906,'2213-0276','Post-traumatic psychiatric disorders: PTSD is not the only diagnosis.','Traumatic events and their consequences are often hidden or minimised by patients for reasons linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder itself (inexpressibility, shame, depressive thoughts, fear of stigmatisation, etc.). Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains the most widely known disorder, chronic post-traumatic psychiatric disorders are many and varied. After a trauma, the practitioner has to check for the different clinical forms of post-traumatic psychological consequences: PTSD is not the only diagnosis. Based on our own clinical experience compared to the international literature, we think necessary to build a didactic classification describing chronic post-traumatic symptoms and syndromes. Post traumatic depressions and bereavement lead to high risk of suicidal crisis and self-harm behaviours. Re-experiencing are felt with anxiety, hyper arousal increases anxious reactivity, and avoidance strategies increase anticipatory anxiety, indicating post-traumatic anxiety disorders (agoraphobia, specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, social phobia). Characterising an often-severe clinical picture, the co-occurrence of post-traumatic and chronic psychotic symptoms is not unusual (post-traumatic schizophrenia, post-traumatic depression with mood-congruent psychotic features, non-schizophrenic post-traumatic psychotic disorder, and bipolar reaction to trauma). A physical injury occurring at the same time as a traumatic exposure increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder later which, in turn, afflicts the subjective perception of the physical health (development of somatoform and psychosomatic disorders, comorbidity with a post-concussion syndrome). The trauma may cause a rupture in the biography of a person, also in his/her internal physiological functioning as in his/her social activities (impacts of instinctive functions and behaviours, personality changes, and adjustment difficulties on professional and personal life). Although a nomenclature is necessary for semiological descriptions, a thorough analysis of the patient\'s general psychological functioning must also be conducted.','2018-03-23 00:00:00','2018-03-23 00:00:00','2018-03-27 00:00:00','Auxéméry, Yann, Y','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(32,4,29573755,'1988-2904','Psychometric Properties of the Spanish Version of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale.','The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is a well-established measure of panic symptoms but few data exist on this instrument in non north-American samples. Our main goal was to assess the psychometric properties (internal consistency, test re-test reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent and divergent validity) and the factor structure of the Spanish version. Ninety-four patients with a main diagnosis of panic disorder were assessed with the Spanish version of PDSS, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) the PDSS self-rating form and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI). The Spanish PDSS showed acceptable internal consistency (α = .74), excellent test-retest (total score and items 1-6: α > .58, p .90) and medium to large convergent validity (r = .68, 95% CI [.54, .79], p < .01; r = .80, 95% CI [.70, .87], p < .01; r = .48, 95% CI [.28, .67], p < .01; BAI, PAS and ASI-3 total scores respectively). Data on divergent validity (BDI-II total score: r = .52, 95% CI [.34, .67], p < .01) suggest some need for refinement of the PDSS. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested a two-factor modified model for the scale (nested χ2 = 14.01, df = 12, p < .001). The Spanish PDSS has similar psychometric properties as the previous versions and is a useful instrument to assess panic symptoms in clinical settings in Spanish-speaking populations.','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00','2018-03-25 00:00:00','Fuste, Gideoni, G|Gil, María Ángeles, MÁ|López-Solà, Clara, C|Rosado, Silvia, S|Bonillo, Albert, A|Pailhez, Guillem, G|Bulbena, Antoni, A|Pérez, Víctor, V|Fullana, Miguel A, MA','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(33,4,29544715,'2212-0289','[The Jena Anxiety Monitoring List (JAMoL) - a tool for the evidence-based treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care].','Behavior therapy-oriented methods are recommended for treating anxiety disorders in primary care. The treatment of patients with long-term conditions can be improved by case management and structured clinical monitoring. The present paper describes the rationale, design and application of the \'Jena Anxiety Monitoring List\' (JAMoL), a monitoring tool for the treatment of patients with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in primary care.JAMoL\'s design was based on established clinical measures, the rationale of exposure-based anxiety treatment, and research on family practice-based case management. After piloting, the JAMoL was used in the clinical study \'Jena-PARADISE\' (ISRCTN64669297), where non-physician practice staff monitored patients with panic disorder by telephone. Using semi-structured interviews in concomitant studies, study participants were asked about the instrument\'s functionality.The JAMoL assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms (6 items) as well as the patient\'s adherence to therapy (4 items) and fosters the case management-related information exchange (3 items). An integrated traffic light scheme facilitates the evaluation of monitoring results. Within the clinical study, non-physician practice staff carried out a total of 1,525 JAMoL-supported monitoring calls on 177 patients from 30 primary care practices (median calls per patient: 10 [interquartile range, 9-10]). Qualitative analyses revealed that most practice teams and patients rated the JAMoL as a practicable and treatment-relevant tool.The JAMoL enables primary care practice teams to continuously monitor anxiety symptoms and treatment adherence in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Within the behavior therapy-oriented treatment program \'Jena-PARADISE\', the JAMoL constitutes an important case management tool.','2018-03-12 00:00:00','2018-03-12 00:00:00','2018-03-16 00:00:00','Hiller, Thomas Stephan, TS|Freytag, Antje, A|Breitbart, Jörg, J|Teismann, Tobias, T|Schöne, Elisabeth, E|Blank, Wolfgang, W|Schelle, Mercedes, M|Vollmar, Horst Christian, HC|Margraf, Jürgen, J|Gensichen, Jochen, J|für die Jena-PARADISE Study Group','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(34,4,29539585,'1879-1379','Running for extinction? Aerobic exercise as an augmentation of exposure therapy in panic disorder with agoraphobia.','Exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (eb-CBT) represents the most evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach in anxiety disorders. However, its efficacy may be limited by a delay in onset of action and a substantial number of patients does not respond sufficiently to treatment. In this context, aerobic exercise was found to be effective in reducing clinical anxiety as well as to improve (elements of) disorder-specific CBT in some mental disorders. We therefore investigated the effect of aerobic exercise supplementary to an eb-CBT in panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG). 77 patients with PD/AG performed a 30 min treadmill task with moderate or low intensity (70% or 30% of the maximal oxygen uptake [VO]) prior to five exposure sessions within a standardized seven-week CBT. At baseline, after completing the treatment period (post) and six month after post (follow-up), several measures of (un)specific psychopathology (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [Ham-A], Mobility Inventory [MI], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale [PAS], Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire [ACQ], Body Sensations Questionnaire [BSQ]) were established to assess for clinical changes. All patients experienced a significant improvement of symptoms from baseline to post (for all measures p < .001) but repeated-measures analyses of variance found a trend towards a significant time × group interaction in the Ham-A in favor for the moderate intense exercise group (f[1, 74] = 4.15, p = .045, α=.025). This trend, however, disappeared at follow-up since the low-intense exercise group further improved significantly in Ham-A after post.

To elucidate the genomic organization of CAR-induced gene responses, we investigated the distribution of TCPOBOP-responsive RefSeq coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes across the megabase-scale topologically associating domains (TADs) that segment the genome, and which provide a structural framework that functionally constrains enhancer-promoter interactions. We show that a subset of TCPOBOP-responsive genes cluster within TADs, and that TCPOBOP-induced genes and TCPOBOP-repressed genes are often found in different TADs. Further, using DNase-seq and DNase hypersensitivity site (DHS) analysis, we identified several thousand genomic regions (ΔDHS) where short-term exposure to TCPOBOP induces localized changes (increases or decreases) in mouse liver chromatin accessibility, many of which cluster in TADs together with TCPOBOP-responsive genes. Sites of chromatin opening were highly enriched nearby genes induced by TCPOBOP and chromatin closing was highly enriched nearby genes repressed by TCPOBOP, consistent with TCPOBOP-responsive ΔDHS serving as enhancers and promoters that positively regulate CAR-responsive genes. Gene expression changes lagged behind chromatin opening or closing for a subset of TCPOBOP-responsive ΔDHS. ΔDHS that were specifically responsive to TCPOBOP in male liver were significantly enriched for genomic regions with a basal male bias in chromatin accessibility; however, the male-biased response of hepatocellular carcinoma-related genes to TCPOBOP was not associated with a correspondingly male-biased ΔDHS response.

In recent decades, important mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have re-emerged and spread widely, in some cases pandemically, to cause serious public health emergencies. There are no licensed vaccines against most of these viruses, and vaccine development and use has been complicated by the number of different viruses to protect against, by subtype and strain variation, and by the inability to predict when and where outbreaks will occur. A new approach to preventing arboviral diseases is suggested by the observation that arthropod saliva facilitates transmission of pathogens, including leishmania parasites, Borrelia burgdorferi, and some arboviruses. Viruses carried within mosquito saliva may more easily initiate host infection by taking advantage of the host\'s innate and adaptive immune responses to saliva. This provides a rationale for creating vaccines against mosquito salivary proteins, rather than against only the virus proteins contained within the saliva. As proof of principle, immunization with sand fly salivary antigens to prevent leishmania infection has shown promising results in animal models.

The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of rash and antibiotic allergy after antibiotic treatment in children with EBV infection.Drug hypersensitivity was investigated in antibiotic-treated patients with a positive EBV IgM who developed a rash between 2013 and 2016.During the study period, 221 children were diagnosed with EBV infection, and 120 (54.3%) patients were treated with antibiotics during disease. Rash developed in 41 (41/221, 18.6%) patients, and 20 of them (total 120; 16.6%) were treated with antibiotics (most frequently aminopenicillins: 72.5%), and 21 of them (total 101, 20.8%) were not treated with antibiotics (p = 0.43). For 10 of the 20 antibiotic-treated patients with a rash, parents did not consent to an allergy workup.

Interestingly, the acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour was inhibited by amiloride, an antagonist of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), but not by AMG-9810, an inhibitor of transient receptor potential cation channel V1(TRPV1). In addition, the relative mRNA and protein expression levels of ASIC1a and ASIC3 were increased in the acid-induced trigeminal nociceptive pathways. Furthermore, blocking CaMKII with KN-93 significantly reduced the acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour and c-FOS gene expression.The data suggested that chronic intermittent administration of an acidic solution to mice resulted in trigeminal hypersensitivity and that dural acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour in mice may mechanistically mimic migraine.

The sample consisted of 24 children diagnosed with leukaemia and solid tumours (58% girls with a mean age of 8.0 years) who underwent an AAT programme consisting of three 30-min sessions in an open group. Two dogs (one Labrador retriever and one golden retriever) were used, and activities such as sensory stimulation, gait training, and socialization were conducted. The exclusion criteria were severe mental problems, inability to answer the questions included in the instruments used, allergy to animals, unavailability/lack of interest, isolation precaution, surgical wound, use of invasive devices, ostomy, no current blood count for evaluation, neutropaenia, infection, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory symptoms at the beginning of the intervention or 1 week before the intervention, hospitalization or scheduled surgery, and non-completion of the AAT programme. The variables analysed using validated self or other evaluations were stress, pain, mood, anxiety, depression, quality of life, heart rate, and blood pressure.

We describe QOL in adult persons with DSD compared to country specific references and assess the impact of diagnosis.The multicentre cross-sectional clinical evaluation (dsd-LIFE) took place in 14 specialized clinics in six European countries. Adolescents (≥16 years) and adults having a DSD condition were included from 02/2014 to 09/2015. The main outcome QOL was measured by the WHOQOL-BREF (domains of physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment). QOL was compared to country specific reference populations by using unpaired t-tests. Linear regression models explained the additional variance of the diagnosis on QOL.Three hundred one individuals with Turner Syndrome, 219 with Klinefelter Syndrome (including XYY), 226 with 46,XX CAH and 294 with rare DSD conditions (gonadal dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome, severe hypospadias, and androgen synthesis errors or other diagnosis) took part. Compared to healthy European populations, QOL was similar in psychological, slightly worse in physical health, and slightly better in environment. In social relationships, QOL was significantly poorer compared to healthy and non-healthy reference populations. In linear regression models health status was the most important predictor of QOL; additional variance was explained by feelings about household\'s income in all domains, and the relationship status in social relationships. Diagnosis explained nearly no additional variance.Except for social relationships, most people with DSD adapt well to their life circumstances and report a good QOL. Not diagnosis, but the individual\'s health status is much more important than previously thought.

ToM performance was examined using the RMET in female-assigned-at-birth individuals with increased prenatal testosterone exposure (Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) and 5-alpha Reductase type-2 Deficiency (5α-RD-2)), female-assigned-at-birth individuals with testosterone insensitivity (Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS)), and their age-matched unaffected male and female relatives.

All subgroups were around 20 years of age. Women with CAH scored significantly lower on RMET than control women and CAIS individuals. CAIS individuals scored significantly higher than control men and participants with 5α-RD. Statistically, CAIS individuals\' performance on RMET was similar to control women\'s, women with CAH did not differ significantly from control men and 5α-RD-2 individuals scored significantly lower than control men.

We performed extensive molecular studies including whole exome sequencing in a Japanese family with PAIS, identifying a deep intronic variant beyond the branch site at intron 6 of AR (NM_000044.4:c.2450-42 G > A). This variant created the splice acceptor motif that was accompanied by pyrimidine-rich sequence and two candidate branch sites. Consistent with this, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments for cycloheximide-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed a relatively large amount of aberrant mRNA produced by the newly created splice acceptor site and a relatively small amount of wildtype mRNA produced by the normal splice acceptor site. Furthermore, most of the aberrant mRNA was shown to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and, if a small amount of aberrant mRNA may have escaped NMD, such mRNA was predicted to generate a truncated AR protein missing some functional domains. These findings imply that the deep intronic mutation creating an alternative splice acceptor site resulted in the production of a relatively small amount of wildtype AR mRNA, leading to PAIS.','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-02 00:00:00','2018-02-14 00:00:00','Ono, Hiroyuki, H|Saitsu, Hirotomo, H|Horikawa, Reiko, R|Nakashima, Shinichi, S|Ohkubo, Yumiko, Y|Yanagi, Kumiko, K|Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko, K|Fukami, Maki, M|Fujisawa, Yasuko, Y|Ogata, Tsutomu, T','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(53,6,29393262,'1661-5433','Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome at Prepuberty: Marked Loss of Spermatogonial Cells at Early Childhood and Presence of Gonocytes up to Puberty.','Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a hereditary condition in patients with a 46,XY karyotype in which loss-of-function mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene are responsible for defects in virilization.

Because suicide loss survivors are susceptible to developing CG, identifying effective treatments for suicide loss survivors with CG is a high priority. This report provides data on the acceptability and effectiveness of antidepressant medication and complicated grief therapy (CGT), a CG-targeted psychotherapy, for suicide loss survivors with CG identified by an Inventory of Complicated Grief score ≥ 30.This is a secondary analysis of data collected from March 2010 to September 2014 for a 4-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of antidepressant medication alone or in combination with CGT for participants with CG (score ≥ 30 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief) who were bereaved by suicide (SB; n = 58), accident/homicide (A/H; n = 74), or natural causes (NC; n = 263). Using mode of death as a grouping factor, we evaluated acceptability of treatments by comparing 12-week medication and 16-session CGT completion; we evaluated effectiveness by comparing response at week 20, defined by a score of 1 or 2 on the Complicated Grief Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CG-CGI-I), and additional secondary response measures.Among participants receiving medication alone, SB medication completion rates (36%) were lower than rates for A/H (54%) and NC (68%; χ² = 11.76, P < .01). SB medication completion rates were much higher for SB individuals receiving CGT (82%; χ² = 12.45, P < .001) than for SB individuals receiving medication alone. CGT completion rates were similar in the 3 groups (SB = 74%, A/H = 64%, NC = 77%; χ² = 2.48, P = .29). For SB participants receiving CGT, CG-CGI-I response rates were substantial (64%), but lower compared to the other groups (A/H = 93%, NC = 84%; χ² = 8.00, P < .05). However, on all other outcomes, changes from baseline for SB participants were comparable to those for A/H and NC participants, including number and severity of grief symptoms, suicidal ideation, and grief-related impairment, avoidance, and maladaptive beliefs.These results raise concern about the acceptability of medication alone as a treatment for complicated grief in treatment-seeking suicide-bereaved adults.

In our study, we aimed to determine relationship between internet addiction with depression, anxiety, self-esteem in adolescents with ADHD and the features of internet use that predicts internet addiction.We studied 111 patients with ADHD aged 12 -18 and 108 healthy contols. Patients and control groups were asked to complete sociodemographic data form, Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), Children\'s Depression Inventory, Childhood Screening Scale for Anxiety of Children, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.IAS total scores of adolescents with ADHD was found significantly higher in comparison to the control group. When compared to the control group, ADHD group depression scale scores were significantly higher, self-esteem scores were statistically lower. There was no difference betweeen the groups in scores of anxiety. IAS scores had positive correlation with depression and anxiety scores, while negatively correlated with self-esteem scores.In the present study, relationship between internet addiction scale scores with depression, anxiety and self-esteem scale scores are similar in the ADHD and the control group. In addition, IAS subscale and total scores were significantly higher in ADHD group than control group even after controlling the effects of self-esteem, depression and anxiety scores.

While chemosensory research using both human and rodent models have indicated a change in emotion can contribute to olfactory dysfunction, there are few studies addressing the contribution of olfaction to a modulation in emotion. In mice, olfactory deficits have been linked with heightened anxiety levels, suggesting that there could be an inverse relationship between olfaction and anxiety. Furthermore, increased anxiety is often co-morbid with psychiatric conditions such as attention disorders. Our study aimed to investigate the roles of olfaction in modulating anxiety. Voltage-gated potassium ion channel Kv1.3 knockout mice (Kv1.3-/-), which have heightened olfaction, and wild-type (WT) mice were examined for anxiety-like behaviors using marble burying (MB), light-dark box (LDB) and elevated-plus maze (EPM) tests. Because Kv1.3-/- mice have increased locomotor activity, inattentive and hyperactive behaviors were quantified for both genotypes. Kv1.3-/- mice showed increased anxiety levels compared to their WT counterparts and administration of methylphenidate (MPH) via oral gavage alleviated their increased anxiety. Object-based attention testing indicated young and older Kv1.3-/- mice had attention deficits and treatment with MPH also ameliorated this condition. Locomotor testing through use of a metabolic chamber indicated that Kv1.3-/- mice were not significantly hyperactive and MPH treatment failed to modify this activity. Our data suggest that heightened olfaction does not necessarily lead to decreased anxiety levels, and that Kv1.3-/- mice may have behaviors associated with inattentiveness.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-03-19 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Huang, Zhenbo, Z|Hoffman, Carlie A, CA|Chelette, Brandon M, BM|Thiebaud, Nicolas, N|Fadool, Debra A, DA','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(68,7,29615850,'1662-4548','Interplay Between the Gut-Brain Axis, Obesity and Cognitive Function.','Obesity continues to be one of the major public health problems due to its high prevalence and co-morbidities. Common co-morbidities not only include cardiometabolic disorders but also mood and cognitive disorders. Obese subjects often show deficits in memory, learning and executive functions compared to normal weight subjects. Epidemiological studies also indicate that obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety, and. These associations between pathologies that presumably have different etiologies suggest shared pathological mechanisms. Gut microbiota is a mediating factor between the environmental pressures (e.g., diet, lifestyle) and host physiology, and its alteration could partly explain the cross-link between those pathologies. Westernized dietary patterns are known to be a major cause of the obesity epidemic, which also promotes a dysbiotic drift in the gut microbiota; this, in turn, seems to contribute to obesity-related complications. Experimental studies in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans suggest that the obesity-associated microbiota may contribute to the endocrine, neurochemical and inflammatory alterations underlying obesity and its comorbidities. These include dysregulation of the HPA-axis with overproduction of glucocorticoids, alterations in levels of neuroactive metabolites (e.g., neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids) and activation of a pro-inflammatory milieu that can cause neuro-inflammation. This review updates current knowledge about the role and mode of action of the gut microbiota in the cross-link between energy metabolism, mood and cognitive function.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-03-16 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Agustí, Ana, A|García-Pardo, Maria P, MP|López-Almela, Inmaculada, I|Campillo, Isabel, I|Maes, Michael, M|Romaní-Pérez, Marina, M|Sanz, Yolanda, Y','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(69,7,29615267,'1872-7123','A 12-month study of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Clinical characterization and different subtypes proposal.','Social withdrawal is a new mental health problem increasingly common, present in different cultures, whose psychopathology and treatment is not yet established.

Considering patients with focal brain tumors, CA is common in left or right parietal and parieto-occipital lesions. In neuropsychology, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test (ROCF) (or parallel forms) is commonly used for the assessment of CA. This study stems from a clinical observation of a difficulty with CA tests for the majority of neurosurgical elderly patients without occipito-parietal lesions.Patients were tested at three different time-points (presurgically, 3 months after surgery, and 12 months after surgery). Thirty patients (15 meningiomas and 15 glioblastomas) were retrospectively studied.results showed that elderly patients with focal brain lesions, regardless of the nature of the tumor, performed very poorly at CA tests: more than 50% of patients obtained pathological results at all the three time-points considered.our findings suggest that CA abilities in neurosurgical elderly patients are fragile and eventually compromised already before surgery, and do not improve with time, no matter the nature of the lesion (malignant vs benign). We speculate that even focal brain tumor may cause a global cognitive deficit and that complex tests which involve multiple domains, such as the ROCF, may be influenced by this general impairment, without a specific correlation to the side and site of the lesion, resulting a too difficult task to cope with.','2018-03-30 00:00:00','2018-03-30 00:00:00','2018-04-02 00:00:00','Fornara, Giorgia Abete, GA|Di Cristofori, Andrea, A|Bertani, Giulio Andrea, GA|Carrabba, Giorgio, G|Zarino, Barbara, B','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(71,8,29593639,'1664-2295','Step by Step: Kinematics of the Reciprocal Trail Making Task Predict Slowness of Activities of Daily Living Performance in Alzheimer\'s Disease.','Dementia impairs the ability to perform everyday activities. Reduced motor capacity and executive functions as well as loss of memory function and forms of apraxia and action disorganization syndrome can be reasons for such impairments. In this study, an analysis of the hand trajectories during the sequential movements in an adapted version of the trail making task, the reciprocal trail making task (RTMT), was used to predict performance in activities of daily living (ADL) of patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 1 patient with dementia of the Alzheimer\'s type and 15 healthy, age-matched adults were tested in the standardized ADL of tea making and document filing. The characteristics of the kinematic performance in the RTMT were assessed, and models of multiple linear regression were computed to predict the durations of the ADL. Patients showed increased trial durations (TDs) in the ADL (Cohen\'s: tea making 1.64, document filing 1.25). Parameters and explained variability differed across patients and control as well as between different activities. The models for the patient sample were stronger and particularly high for the document filing task for which kinematics explained 71% of the variance ([Formula: see text]: tea making 0.62, document filing 0.71; both tasks combined patients 0.55, controls 0.25). The most relevant factors for the models were the TD and a parameter characterizing movement fluency and variability (\"movement harmonicity\") in the RTMT. The models of multiple linear regression suggested that the patients\' activity of daily living performance was limited by cognitive demands, namely, identifying the varying targets during sequencing and the healthy controls\' performance by their motor capacity.

Rapidly progressive dementia, however, is rarely observed in acute HIV infection or during immune reconstitution. Recently, a case of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) has been reported in a patient with chronic HIV infection. The incidence of CJD is not known to be increased among immunocompromised patients.We here report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with a recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia presenting with secondary behavioral changes and disorientation. Over the course of several weeks, progressive dementia developed characterized by apraxia, gait ataxia, and mutism.After the exclusion of common HIV-associated neurologic conditions, the clinical course as well as findings on electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive 14-3-3 assay converged into a probable diagnosis of CJD. The diagnosis was later confirmed histopathologically.Palliative care was provided, and the patient passed away within 2 months of symptom onset.HIV/AIDS is an important stratifying condition during the work-up of many clinical syndromes including encephalopathy but may prematurely exclude important differential diagnoses. Non-opportunistic etiologies have to be considered as part of a secondary workup as this case of concomitant AIDS and CJD demonstrates. Rapidly progressive dementia should be distinguished from delirium as early as possible in order to be able to choose the correct diagnostic pathway.

In 1907, Jose Ingeniero published in French his book about \"amusia\", Cristofredo Jakob the \"folia neurobiologica\" where he described the organization of the human brain, Vicente Dimitri in 1933 his book \"aphasia\" and Bernardo de Quiros in 1959 his works about dyslexia. The psychiatry at the hospices with the German influence from Jakob developed to the modern neuropsychiatry with Juan Carlos Goldar. The argentine school of psychology by the holism and the psychoanalysis influence do not accept the neuropsychology until 1960 where was included at the school of psychology from the university of Buenos Aires (UBA) with the first linguistics works of Juan Azcoaga. At the 80, began the North American influence of the neurology with authors like Carlos Mangone (dementia), Ramon Leiguarda (apraxia), Sergio Starkstein (depression and apathy) and Ricardo Allegri (memory and Alzheimer). In 1982 the Argentine Neuropsychological Society was founded and in 1987 was the working group of dementia from the Argentine Neurological Society. At this moment, Aldo Ferreres organized the chair of neuropsychology at the school of psychology (UBA). Nowadays, the growing as discipline is in context of the psychology, neurology and psychiatry in the way of the recent cognitive neurosciences.','2017-11-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-09 00:00:00','Allegri, Ricardo F, RF|Bagnatti, Pablo, P','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(78,8,29519468,'0072-9752','Limb apraxia and the left parietal lobe.','Limb apraxia is a heterogeneous disorder of skilled action and tool use that has long perplexed clinicians and researchers. It occurs after damage to various loci in a densely interconnected network of regions in the left temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Historically, a highly classificatory approach to the study of apraxia documented numerous patterns of performance related to two major apraxia subtypes: ideational and ideomotor apraxia. More recently, there have been advances in our understanding of the functional neuroanatomy and connectivity of the left-hemisphere \"tool use network,\" and the patterns of performance that emerge from lesions to different loci within this network. This chapter focuses on the left inferior parietal lobe, and its role in tool and body representation, action prediction, and action selection, and how these functions relate to the deficits seen in patients with apraxia subsequent to parietal lesions. Finally, suggestions are offered for several future directions that will benefit the study of apraxia, including increased attention to research on rehabilitation of this disabling disorder.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-21 00:00:00','Buxbaum, Laurel J, LJ|Randerath, Jennifer, J','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(79,8,29519467,'0072-9752','Constructional apraxia.','Since the classic papers of Kleist, Mayer Gross, and Critchley, constructional apraxia (CA) has been considered to be a typical sign of a parietal lobe lesion, and as a precious tool to appreciate the spatial abilities subserved by this lobe. However, the development of more sophisticated neuropsychologic models and methods of investigation has revealed several problematic aspects. It has become increasingly clear that CA is a heterogeneous construct that can be examined with very different tasks, that are only mildly interconnected, and tap various kinds of visuospatial, perceptual, attentional, planning, and motor mechanisms. On the basis of these considerations, the relationships between parietal lobe functions and constructional activities must be considered, taking into account on the one hand the heterogeneity of the tasks and of the cognitive functions requested by different kinds of constructional activities and, on the other hand, the plurality of functions and of processing streams linking different parts of the parietal lobes to the occipital and frontal lobes.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-09 00:00:00','Gainotti, Guido, G|Trojano, Luigi, L','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(80,9,29617923,'1476-6256','Breastfeeding And Childhood Wheeze: Age-Specific Analyses And Longitudinal Wheezing Phenotypes As Complimentary Approaches To The Analysis Of Cohort Data.','Systematic reviews suggest that breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of asthma, although marked heterogeneity exists. Using UK Millennium Cohort Study data (n = 10,126 children born 2000-2001), we examined the association between breastfeeding duration and wheezing in the past year, first at each age-group separately (age 9 months, 3, 5, 7 and 11 years) and then as a longitudinal wheezing phenotype: \'early transient\' (wheezing any time up to age 5 but not thereafter); \'late onset\' (any time from age 7 but not beforehand); \'persistent\' (any time up to age 5 and any time from age 7). The association between breastfeeding and wheeze varied by age (interaction two-sided P = 0.0003). For example, breastfeeding for 6-9 months was associated with lower odds of wheezing at age 9 months, 3, and 5 years, but less so at age 7 and 11 years (adjusted odds ratios 0.73, 0.78, 0.79, 0.84, 1.06 respectively). There was a strong dose response relationship for breastfeeding per month and early transient wheeze (adjusted linear trend OR 0.961, 95% CI: 0.942, 0.980), but no clear trend for late onset or persistent wheeze.

Epidemiological and molecular evidence has highlighted an association between severe childhood respiratory viral infection and chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, animal models have demonstrated the ability of hMPV to persist in vivo suggesting a role of the virus in asthma development in children. However, mechanisms involved in hMPV persistence in the respiratory tract are not yet understood. In the present study we monitored hMPV infection in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells in order to understand if the virus is able to persist in these cells upon acute infection. Our data show that hMPV initially induces an apoptotic process in A549 cells through poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage, caspase-3/7 activation and Wee1 activity. The hMPV-infected cells were then able to overcome the apoptotic pathway and cell cycle arrest in G2/M by expressing B-cell lymphoma 2 and to acquire a reservoir cell phenotype with constant production of infectious virus. These findings provide evidence of the ability of hMPV to persist in alveolar epithelial cells and help in understanding the mechanisms responsible for hMPV persistence in the human respiratory tract.','2018-03-01 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Marsico, Stefania, S|Caccuri, Francesca, F|Mazzuca, Pietro, P|Apostoli, Paola, P|Roversi, Sara, S|Lorenzin, Giovanni, G|Zani, Alberto, A|Fiorentini, Simona, S|Giagulli, Cinzia, C|Caruso, Arnaldo, A','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(82,9,29617470,'1984-0462','APPLICABILITY OF A GENERIC QUESTIONNAIRE FOR QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT FOR ASTHMATIC CHILDREN.','To determine the applicability of the generic instrument Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) to assess health-related quality of life of asthmatic children compared to the specific instrument Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ).This research involved the evaluation of 30 children aged seven to eleven years, who had been diagnosed with asthma for at least six months prior to research.

A Bayesian two-stage hurdle model was used to estimate average cost of illness and Bayesian logistic regression models were used to estimate the disease-specific incidence of catastrophic health payment and impoverishment. The concentration curve and index were estimated by disease category to examine inequality in healthcare-related financial hardship.Inflation-adjusted mean out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for chronic illness and injury increased by 4.6% and 7.3%, respectively, while the cost of recent acute illness declined by 1.5% between 1995 and 2010. Injury showed the highest incidence of catastrophic expenditure (30.7% in 1995 and 22.4% in 2010) followed by chronic illness (12.0% in 1995 and 9.6% in 2010) and recent acute illness (21.1% in 1995 and 7.8% in 2010). Asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, malaria, jaundice and parasitic illnesses showed increased catastrophic health expenditure over time. Impoverishment due to injury declined most (by 12% change in average annual rate) followed by recent acute illness (9.7%) and chronic illness (9.6%) in 15 years. Inequality analysis indicated that poorer populations with recent acute illness suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in both sample years, while wealthier households with injury and chronic illnesses suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in 2010.To minimize the economic burden of illness, several approaches need to be adopted, including social health insurance complemented with an upgraded community-based health insurance system, subsidy program expansion for diseases with high economic burden and third party liability motor insurance to reduce the economic burden of injury.','2018-04-05 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','Swe, Khin Thet, KT|Rahman, Md Mizanur, MM|Rahman, Md Shafiur, MS|Saito, Eiko, E|Abe, Sarah K, SK|Gilmour, Stuart, S|Shibuya, Kenji, K','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(85,9,29617249,'1474-547X','Asthma in US children.','No abstract found.','2018-02-17 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-04-04 00:00:00','The Lancet','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(86,9,29617210,'1532-4303','Effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during pregnancy on lung function in preschoolers: a clinical trial.','Prenatal omega-3 fatty acids improve alveolarization, diminish inflammation, and improve pulmonary growth, but it is unclear whether these outcomes translate into improved postnatal lung function.We assessed the effect of prenatal supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on offspring lung function through 60 months of age.We included a cohort of 772 Mexican preschoolers whose mothers participated in a clinical trial (NCT00646360) of supplementation with DHA or a placebo from week 18-22 of gestation through delivery.The children were followed after birth and anthropometric measurements and forced oscillation tests were performed at 36, 48, and 60 months of age.

BoNTs are 150-kDa protein toxins organized into heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) domains linked by a disulfide bond. The HC selectively binds to neurons and aids cell entry of the enzymatically active LC. There are seven immunological BoNT serotypes (A to G); each serotype includes genetic variants, termed subtypes. Only two subtypes, BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1, are currently used as therapeutics. BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) subtypes A2 to A8 show distinct potency, duration of action, and pathology relative to BoNT/A1. Specifically, BoNT/A3 possesses shorter duration of action and elicits distinct symptoms in mice at high toxin doses. In this report, we analyzed the roles of LC and HC of BoNT/A3 for duration of action, neuronal cell entry, and mouse pathology by using clostridium-derived recombinant hybrid BoNTs consisting of reciprocal LC and HC (BoNTA1/A3 and BoNTA3/A1). Hybrid toxins were processed in their expression host to a dichain BoNT consisting of LC and HC linked via a disulfide bond. The LC and HC defined BoNT potency in mice and BoNT toxicity for cultured neuronal cells, while the LC defined the duration of BoNT action in cell and mouse models. Protein alignment identified a previously unrecognized region within the LC subtype A3 (LC/A3) relative to the other LC serotype A (LC/A) subtypes (low primary acid homology [LPH]) that correlated to intracellular LC localization. This study shows the utility of recombinant hybrid BoNTs with new therapeutic potential, while remaining sensitive to antitoxins and therapies to native BoNT.Botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent protein toxins for humans and potential bioterrorism threats, but they are also widely used as pharmaceuticals. Within the large family of BoNTs, only two subtypes are currently used as pharmaceuticals, with a large number of BoNT subtypes remaining as untapped potential sources for unique pharmaceuticals. Here, two recombinant hybrid toxins were engineered, consisting of domains from two BoNT subtypes that possess distinct duration of action and activity in human neurons and mice. We define the functional domains responsible for BoNT action and demonstrate creation of functional hybrid BoNTs with new therapeutic potential, while remaining sensitive to antitoxins and therapies to native BoNT.','2018-03-27 00:00:00','2018-03-27 00:00:00','2018-04-03 00:00:00','Pellett, Sabine, S|Bradshaw, Marite, M|Tepp, William H, WH|Pier, Christina L, CL|Whitemarsh, Regina C M, RCM|Chen, Chen, C|Barbieri, Joseph T, JT|Johnson, Eric A, EA','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(91,10,29577785,'1476-4954','Botulism in pregnancy - A clinical approach to diagnosis and management.','Botulism is a life-threatening toxin mediated disease that often presents with a sudden rapid onset of paralysis of their skeletal muscles with subsequent respiratory compromise and sudden death.

Medical providers caring for such patients should not only maintain a high level of suspicion for botulism, but administration of an antitoxin early in their care can help reduce morbidity and mortality, while awaiting confirmatory laboratory results.

This investigation reviews various categories of headaches, their pathophysiology, and types of interventional treatments currently available.Injection of botulinum toxin has been shown to increase the number of headache free days for patients suffering from chronic tension-type headaches.

Nitrite serves as a color-fixing agent in processed meat products. However, N-nitroso compounds can be produced from nitrite. They are considered as carcinogens. Thus, consumers desire processed meat products that contain lower concentrations (below conventional concentrations of products) of nitrite or no nitrite at all, although the portion of nitrite intake by processed meat consumption in total nitrite intake is very low. However, lower nitrite levels might expose consumers to risk of botulism poisoning due to C. botulinum or illness caused by other foodborne pathogens. Hence, lower nitrite concentrations in combination with other factors such as low pH, high NaCl level, and others have been recommended to decrease the risk of food poisoning. In addition, natural compounds that can inhibit bacterial growth and function as color-fixing agents have been developed to replace nitrite in processed meat products. However, their antibotulinal effects have not been fully clarified. Therefore, to have processed meat products with lower nitrite concentrations, low pH, high NaCl concentration, and others should also be applied together.

Thiamine deficiency has also been suggested as a causal or contributing factor.

Herring gulls from Iceland served as controls. Necropsies and histopathology were performed on 75 birds, of which 12 showed signs of disease at the time of necropsy. Parasites of various classes and tissues were commonly observed independent of host age, e.g. oesophageal capillariosis and nematode infection in the proventriculus and gizzard with severe inflammation, air sac larid pentastomes and bursal trematodiasis in pre-fledglings. Gross and microscopic findings are described. Notably, amyloidosis was diagnosed in 93 and 33% of the adult birds from Sweden and Iceland, respectively (p<0.001), with more pronounced deposits in Swedish birds (p<0.001). Gastrointestinal deposits were observed in the walls of arteries or arterioles, and occasionally in villi near the mucosal surface. Amyloid was identified within the intestinal lumen in one severely affected gull suggesting the possibility of oral seeding and the existence of a primed state as previously described in some mammals and chickens. This could speculatively explain the high occurrence and previously reported rapid onset of amyloidosis upon inflammation or captivity in Herring gulls.

The scFvs were converted to IgG that had Kvalues for the different BoNT/E subtypes ranging from 9.7 nM to 2.28 pM. An equimolar combination of the three mAbs was able to potently neutralize BoNT/E1, BoNT/E3, and BoNT/E4 in a mouse neutralization assay. The mAbs have potential utility as therapeutics and as diagnostics capable of recognizing multiple BoNT/E subtypes. A derivative of the three-antibody combination (NTM-1633) is in pre-clinical development with an investigational new drug (IND) application filing expected in 2018.','2018-03-01 00:00:00','2018-03-01 00:00:00','2018-03-30 00:00:00','Garcia-Rodriguez, Consuelo, C|Razai, Ali, A|Geren, Isin N, IN|Lou, Jianlong, J|Conrad, Fraser, F|Wen, Wei-Hua, WH|Farr-Jones, Shauna, S|Smith, Theresa J, TJ|Brown, Jennifer L, JL|Skerry, Janet C, JC|Smith, Leonard A, LA|Marks, James D, JD','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(96,10,29475762,'1873-2518','Safety and immunogenicity of investigational recombinant botulinum vaccine, rBV A/B, in volunteers with pre-existing botulinum toxoid immunity.','We undertook an open-label, uncontrolled study of investigational recombinant botulinum vaccine for botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotypes A and B (rBV A/B) to assess its safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers who had been previously immunized with investigational pentavalent botulinum toxoid. Study participants who wished to do so could donate their hyperimmune plasma for production of Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (BIG-IV, BabyBIG®).A single 0.5 ml (mL), 40-microgram intramuscular injection of rBV A/B was administered to study participants. Post-vaccination sera collected at approximately 2-week intervals were evaluated for anti-BoNT/A and anti-BoNT/B neutralizing antibody concentrations (NAC). Local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were identified by clinical and laboratory monitoring for 12 weeks post-vaccination with a final telephone follow-up for additional safety assessment at 6 months. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was a ≥4-fold rise in NAC in ≥50% of participants by Week 4 post-vaccination.All 45 enrolled participants completed the study. Forty-two of 45 participants (93.3%) experienced at least one TEAE. Overall, 138 of 218 (63.3%) reported TEAEs were treatment-related, the majority of which were mild injection-site reactions. No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The study achieved its primary immunogenicity endpoint with 37/45 (82.2%) participants and 39/45 (86.7%) participants having a ≥4-fold rise in NAC to anti-BoNT/A and to anti-BoNT/B, respectively, by Week 4 post-vaccination.A single 0.5 mL dose of rBV A/B was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in participants previously immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid.

Due to these limitations, a recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) product is preferable. It has been shown that combining three mAbs that bind non-overlapping epitopes leads to highly potent botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) neutralization. Recently, a triple human antibody combination for BoNT/A has demonstrated potent toxin neutralization in mouse models with no serious adverse events when tested in a Phase I clinical trial. However, a triple antibody therapeutic poses unique development and manufacturing challenges. Thus, potentially to streamline development of BoNT antitoxins, we sought to achieve the potency of multiple mAb combinations in a single IgG-based molecule that has a long serum half-life. The design, production, and testing of a single tri-epitopic IgG1-based mAb (TeAb) containing the binding sites of each of the three parental BoNT/A mAbs yielded an antibody of nearly equal potency to the combination.

There is a strong correlation between central obesity and cardiovascular disease. Abdominal obesity is not confined only to the elderly and obese subjects. Abdominal obesity has been linked to Alzheimer\'s disease as well as other metabolic and vascular diseases. Visceral and central abdominal fat and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes. Visceral fat, also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat, is located inside the peritoneal cavity, packed in between internal organs and torso, as opposed to subcutaneous fat‚ which is found underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat‚ which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) and perirenal fat. An excess of visceral fat is known as central obesity, the \"pot belly\" or \"beer belly\" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as \"apple shaped‚\" as opposed to \"pear shaped‚\" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks. Researchers first started to focus on abdominal obesity in the 1980s when they realized that it had an important connection to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Abdominal obesity was more closely related with metabolic dysfunctions connected with cardiovascular disease than was general obesity. In the late 1980s and early 1990s insightful and powerful imaging techniques were discovered that would further help advance the understanding of the health risks associated with body fat accumulation. Techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to categorize mass of adipose tissue located at the abdominal level into intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Obesity6.JPG?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdominal_obesity','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(2,'Achondroplasia',56579,742386653,'DOID_4480','Achondroplasia is a common cause of dwarfism.

Achondroplastic adults are known to be as short as 62.8 cm (24.7 in).

It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats. These fats build up in the brain. They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves. This can cause seizures and hyperactivity. It can also cause problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy). ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0). The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. Treatment options for ALD are limited. Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo\'s oil. For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course. Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated. ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000. It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.','http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Adrenoleukodystrophy.jpg?width=300','http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrenoleukodystrophy','2018-04-05 17:25:40','2018-04-05 17:25:40'),(4,'Agoraphobia',57723,744775147,'DOID_593','Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away.

The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and lasts for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes. The cause of agoraphobia is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5 agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. Those affected are at higher risk of depression and substance use disorder. Without treatment it is uncommon for agoraphobia to resolve. Treatment is typically with a type of counselling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT results in resolution for about half of people. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of adults. Women are affected about twice as often as men. The condition often begins in early adulthood and becomes less common in old age. It is rare in children.

These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. Common allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body\'s immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person\'s medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear. Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, about 6% of people have at least one food allergy, and about 20% have atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country about 1–18% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing.

As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome. AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized.

The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder. The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, a family history of mental disorders, and poverty. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other psychiatric and medical problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine , alcohol or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs. Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioural therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may improve symptoms. About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year. They occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin before the age of 25.

Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. There is no cure for asthma. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required. In 2013, 242 million people globally had asthma up from 183 million in 1990.

The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people.
